# Web3 Analytics Resources

This technical guide provides end-to-end tutorials on how to analyze specific protocols in web3. It highlights the challenges of analyzing protocols in web3, which include the ever-expanding data battlefield as new protocols, tokens, and wallets join the fray and add to the chaos. The guide provides tips on scoping your work and finding what to analyze. It also emphasizes the importance of metrics-driven analysis and provides two great end-to-end video series guides for metrics analysis. 

The guide explains that protocol metrics are usually dependent on different token and wallet segments. For example, Uniswap allows you to create pairs of two tokens at a time to add liquidity and swap through. However, the USDC-WETH pair will have very different behaviors from SHIB-WETH. To understand token trends and contexts, the guide recommends checking out the ERC20 dashboard and the NFT dashboard. To understand wallet/user segments, you'll need to leverage labels to enhance your analysis.

The guide also emphasizes the importance of sharing your work with the community. When you're done, be sure to share your work in the Discord `#ðŸ“ºï¸±show-your-work` channel and on Twitter tagging @duneanalytics. The guide provides more community guides and resources to help you get started with querying on Dune Analytics.

The guide also includes a section on the OurNetwork Course, which is based on Dune's V1 engine. The course teaches 30 people web3 data analytics in 30 days and covers all of the important topics you'll need to know to effectively analyze blockchain data and become a full-fledged Dune Wizard. The guide provides a link to the course materials and encourages readers to consider buying an edition of the Mirror post to support the teachers of this course.
