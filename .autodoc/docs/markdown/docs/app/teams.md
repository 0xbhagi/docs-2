# Teams

This technical guide covers the Teams feature of the Dune app. Teams are shared workspaces for Wizards to collaborate within. The guide explains the benefits of creating a Team, such as collaborating on the same content, having a separate workspace for each Team, and showcasing all of a Team's work in one place. It also explains the different user roles available for Team members, such as viewers, editors, and admins.

The guide provides step-by-step instructions for getting started with Teams, including creating a Team, adding users, and transferring content to a Team. It also explains how to find a Team's content using the My Creations feature and provides a FAQ section that addresses common questions about Teams.

For example, to create a Team, users need to head over to Settings > Teams and add a bit of sparkle to their Team's profile. They can then invite other Dune Wizards to join their Team in the People section of their Team's Settings page and assign them one of the available roles. Team Queries and Dashboards are created the same way they are for individual accounts, and users can pick their Team as the Owner when prompted to save them for the first time.

Overall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Teams feature of the Dune app and is a useful resource for users who want to collaborate with others on shared content.
