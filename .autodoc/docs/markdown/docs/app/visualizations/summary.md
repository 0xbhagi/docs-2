The `docs/app/visualizations` folder contains a collection of technical guides focused on creating and customizing visualizations using the Dune app. These guides cover various types of visualizations, including charts, graphs, tables, counters, and embeds. The folder is organized into four main files: `charts-graphs.md`, `embeds.md`, `index.md`, and `other-visualizations.md`.

The `charts-graphs.md` guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Charts & Graphs feature of the Dune app. It covers different types of graphs, such as bar charts, area charts, scatter charts, line charts, pie charts, and mixed graphs, along with examples and editing options for each graph type. This guide is useful for users who want to create visually appealing and informative graphs to represent their data.

The `embeds.md` guide focuses on the use of Embeds in the Dune app, which allows users to share live Dune charts across different web platforms like Twitter, Discord, web pages, and Mirror.xyz. This guide explains how to generate embed links and use them on various platforms, providing examples and code snippets to help users get started with Embeds. This guide is beneficial for users who want to share their visualizations with a wider audience.

The `index.md` guide serves as an introduction to the Visualizations section of the app technical guide. It provides a brief overview of the two main sections: Charts & Graphs and Other Visualizations. This guide is helpful for users who are new to Dune and want to understand the different types of visualizations available and how to create them.

The `other-visualizations.md` guide covers non-graph visualizations, such as tables and counters. It explains how to create and customize tables, which are the default visualization when a query is run, and counters, which display "at a glance" stats. This guide is useful for users who want to create simple yet informative visualizations to represent their data.

Overall, the guides in the `docs/app/visualizations` folder provide valuable information for users who want to create and customize visualizations using the Dune app. These guides cover various types of visualizations and provide examples and editing options to help users create visually appealing and informative representations of their data.
