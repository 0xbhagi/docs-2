# Embeds

This technical guide explains how to use the Embeds feature in the Dune Docs project. Embeds allow users to share live Dune charts across different web platforms. The guide starts by explaining how to generate an embed link by clicking on any query title and selecting the embed function in the top right corner. The guide also clarifies that the embed button works as a standalone link and as a way to embed live graphs into websites/apps. If a query has no visualizations, the link will be to the query results table. If there are multiple visualizations, the link will be for whichever visualization the user has selected when they clicked the Embed button.

The guide then goes on to explain how to use Embeds on different platforms such as Twitter, Discord, web pages, and Mirror.xyz. For Twitter, users can simply paste their embed link, and Twitter will render and update Dune visualizations automatically. For Discord, users can drop the embed link in the chat, and the corresponding visualization will be displayed. The guide also explains how to add live visualizations to any web page using an `iframe` and provides a code snippet example. For Mirror.xyz, users can easily embed Dune visualizations into articles by generating an embed link and postfixing it with `?display=iframe`.

The guide also highlights some known issues with Embeds, stating that they do not work in a couple of popular web platforms such as Substack, Medium, and GitBook. Finally, the guide explains how to use parameterized embeds, which work with parameterized queries. However, it is a bit tricky to get them to work, and users need to manually prefix the parameter link with the parameters. The guide provides an example of how to do this.

Overall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of how to use the Embeds feature in the Dune Docs project. It covers different platforms and provides examples and code snippets to help users understand how to use Embeds effectively.
