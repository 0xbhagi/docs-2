# Other Visualizations

This guide covers non-graph visualizations that can be created using Dune. The guide is divided into two sections: Tables and Counters.

## Tables

Tables are the default visualization that appears when a query is run. The guide explains how to create additional tables and customize them. The following options can be configured for each column in a table:

- Title: The title that appears at the top of the column. If left blank, the column title will be the same as its Dune database name.
- Align: The text alignment for the column data and title.
- Format: The numerical format of the data.
- Hide Column: Hides the column from the table.

Numerical columns have additional options:

- Type: Displays the column's numerical data or shows it with a progress bar visual.
- Colored Values: Colors positive values green and negative values red.

## Counters

Counters are a way to display "on a glance" stats. The guide explains how to configure counters and adjust how numerical data is displayed. The following options can be configured for counters:

- Title: The title that appears at the top of the counter. If left blank, the query name will be the only thing displayed.
- Column: The column the counter should show.
- Row: The row of the underlying data table to be displayed.
- Prefix: A prefix for the counter value.
- Suffix: A suffix for the counter value.
- Label: A label for the counter value.
- Decimals: The number of decimal places to be displayed.

The guide provides examples and screenshots to illustrate how to configure tables and counters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of Dune Docs and how does it relate to blockchain technology?
- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of Dune Docs or its relation to blockchain technology, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to seek additional documentation or context.
2. Can Dune Docs visualize data from blockchain databases?
- The app technical guide does not specify which types of databases Dune Docs can visualize, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to investigate further to determine if it is compatible with blockchain databases.
3. Are there any limitations to the numerical data formatting options for Counters?
- The app technical guide states that the number of decimal places is currently limited to 3, but it does not provide information on any other limitations or restrictions, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to test the app or consult with the development team to determine any other limitations.
