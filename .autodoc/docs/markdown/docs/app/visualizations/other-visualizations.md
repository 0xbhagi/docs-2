This app technical guide covers non-graph visualizations that can be created using Dune. The guide is divided into two sections: Tables and Counters. 

The Tables section explains how to create tables to display data. The default visualization for query results is a table, and users can create additional tables using the "New visualization" button and drop-down menu. The guide provides instructions on how to configure tables, including options for the table title and each column. Users can adjust the text alignment, numerical format, and visibility of each column. For numerical columns, users can choose between a normal display or a progress bar display, and can color positive and negative values. 

The Counters section explains how to create counters, which are useful for displaying "on a glance" stats. Users can define which column and row of the underlying data table they want to display, and can adjust the formatting of the numerical data. Users can add a prefix or suffix to the counter value, and can choose how many decimal places to display. Additionally, users can add a label beneath the counter value. 

The guide provides several examples of each type of visualization, including screenshots of the configuration options. Overall, this guide is a useful resource for users who want to create non-graph visualizations using Dune.
