# Ecosystem Dashboards

This technical guide covers the Ecosystem Dashboards feature of the Dune app. The purpose of this feature is to provide users with a way to explore and discover general ecosystem-level metrics related to blockchain data. 

The first section of the guide focuses on Gas Prices, which is a dashboard created by @kroeger0x. This dashboard provides data on average gas spent per transaction, gas limit, gas spent in total in a block, and more. The dashboard is designed to be easy to view and understand, and it is accessible through Dune. Two screenshots of the dashboard are provided as examples.

The second section of the guide focuses on DeFi Adoption, which is a dashboard created by @rchen8. This dashboard compiles user numbers from all important DeFi protocols into one place. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide users with a way to easily track DeFi adoption over time. A screenshot of the dashboard is provided as an example.

Overall, the Ecosystem Dashboards feature of the Dune app is designed to provide users with a way to explore and discover general ecosystem-level metrics related to blockchain data. The Gas Prices and DeFi Adoption dashboards are two examples of the types of metrics that can be explored using this feature.
## Questions: 
 1. What blockchain data is available in Dune and how is it organized? 
2. Can Dune be used to analyze specific blockchain transactions or only general ecosystem-level metrics? 
3. Are there any limitations or potential biases in the data presented in the Gas Prices and DeFi Adoption dashboards?
