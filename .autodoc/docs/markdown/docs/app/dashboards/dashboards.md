# How To Create a Dashboard

This technical guide covers the process of creating a dashboard on Dune, which is where the app's content lives and gets discovered. Dashboards consist of widgets, which can either be visualizations or text boxes. It is also possible to embed images or GIFs inside of the text box. The guide explains how to create a dashboard, add visualizations, add text boxes, and arrange the layout of the dashboard.

To create a new dashboard, navigate to the "Discover" page and click on the "new Dashboard" button on the right. The initial name that you give to your dashboard will also be the URL slug. You can't change the URL slug afterwards, so be mindful of the name you choose. Changing the dashboard's display name is always possible though.

Visualizations can be added to the dashboard by going into the editor mode and clicking on the corresponding button. To go into editor mode, first open one of your own dashboards and click on the edit button on the top right.

Text boxes can be added to the dashboard by going into editor mode and clicking on "add text widget". This will open a simple text editor window. Text boxes support a subset of markdown, which is explained in the guide. You can manipulate text and embed images and GIFs.

The guide also explains how to embed images and GIFs into the dashboard. Since images cannot be stored locally on Dune's servers, you need to upload your images somewhere else or find the raw file somewhere on the internet. The syntax for embedding images is also explained in the guide.

Finally, the guide explains how to arrange the different widgets on the dashboard in whatever way you like. Widgets will always try to move upwards, so if you want to create a visual divider section in your dashboard, it is advised to create a big text box as a divider.

Overall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to create a dashboard on Dune, including adding visualizations, text boxes, and images/GIFs, as well as arranging the layout of the dashboard. The guide is accompanied by examples and screenshots to make the process easier to understand.
