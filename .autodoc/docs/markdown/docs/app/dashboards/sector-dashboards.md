# Sector Dashboards

This technical guide covers the Sector Dashboards feature of the Dune Docs project. Sector Dashboards provide an overview of an entire sector of the crypto economy and allow users to analyze what's happening in real-time. The purpose of this guide is to explain how Sector Dashboards work and provide examples of how they can be used.

The guide starts with an overview of Sector Dashboards and their purpose. It then provides examples of three different Sector Dashboards: Dex Metrics, Indices, and Lending. Each example includes a link to the dashboard and a brief explanation of what it shows.

The Dex Metrics dashboard provides data on the entire Decentralized Exchange sector, including metrics like Dex Volume, Market Share, and Total Volume across all exchanges. The dashboard is maintained by the community, and new DEXes can be added by submitting code to the public GitHub.

The Indices dashboard covers the entire state of a sector in one glance, allowing users to compare different products and projects with ease. It provides data on the AUM (Assets Under Management) of different indices and projects.

The Lending dashboard allows users to easily check the state of lending as a sector and compare protocol performance. It provides data on lending deposits and borrowers.

Overall, this guide provides an introduction to Sector Dashboards and how they can be used to analyze different sectors of the crypto economy. The examples provided demonstrate the usefulness of Sector Dashboards in providing real-time data and insights into different sectors.
