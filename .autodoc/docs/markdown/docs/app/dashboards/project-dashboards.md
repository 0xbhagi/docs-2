# Project Dashboards

This technical guide covers the topic of Project Dashboards, which is a feature of the Dune Docs project. Project Dashboards allow users to easily assemble data on their favorite project in one place without having to maintain infrastructure or overhead. The purpose of this guide is to explain how to use Project Dashboards and provide an example of how they can be used.

The guide starts by explaining that Project Dashboards are a great way to track the metrics of your project. It then goes on to explain that you can simply query for the data you desire and assemble it on a Dashboard to make a Datahub for your project Reality. This means that users can easily view and understand important data about their project without having to go through multiple sources.

The guide then provides an example of a Project Dashboard for Tornado.Cash by @poma. The Dashboard shows many important metrics for the protocol, all in one place. The guide explains that @poma wanted to show a few "at a glance" counters which make important data like total deposits and unique users easy to view and understand by just about anyone. @poma follows this up with some interesting historical data points which show the growth in users and volume. The Dashboard continues, but you can clearly already see how much value these stats and charts can produce for a company, protocol, or community.

Finally, the guide provides a link to the Dune Projects Page where users can find many other great Dashboards. This guide is useful for users who want to learn how to use Project Dashboards and how they can be used to track the metrics of their project.
## Questions: 
 1. What kind of data sources does this app support for assembling project dashboards?
   - The app technical guide mentions that users can "simply query for the data you desire" to assemble a dashboard, but it does not specify what kind of data sources are supported.

2. Can this app be integrated with blockchain data sources?
   - The app technical guide does not mention anything about integrating with blockchain data sources, which might be of interest to a blockchain SQL analyst.

3. Are there any limitations to the types of metrics that can be tracked on a project dashboard?
   - The app technical guide does not mention any limitations to the types of metrics that can be tracked on a project dashboard, but a blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any restrictions or limitations to the types of data that can be displayed.
