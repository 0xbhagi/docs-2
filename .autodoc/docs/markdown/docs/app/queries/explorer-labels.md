# Data Explorer Labels

This technical guide covers the labels used in the Data Explorer of the Dune Docs project. The guide provides a detailed explanation of the different labels used in the project, including blockchain icons, dataset icons, dataset labels, and data type labels.

The blockchain icons section explains the different blockchain icons that can be found in some data sets. Each icon represents a specific blockchain, including Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche C-Chain, Ethereum Goerli Testnet, and Fantom. The icons can represent raw data, decoded projects, or spells.

The dataset icons section explains the different icons that represent data tables, decoded projects, spells, and community data sets. The data table icon can represent raw data, spells, or smart contract events or functions. The decoded project icon represents a protocol or protocol version, such as "opensea" or "aave_v2". The spell icon represents a spell set, such as cow_protocol containing "batches" and "solvers" spells. The community data icon represents a community data set.

The dataset labels section explains the different labels that can be used to identify a specific data set. The labels include project, sector, event, and function. The project label represents a spell set for a specific project, such as "aave". The sector label represents a spell set for a sector, such as "dex". The event label represents a smart contract event dataset, and the function label represents a smart contract function dataset.

The data type labels section explains the different labels used to represent data types. The labels include string, long, integer, double, boolean, date, timestamp, decimal, and array. The guide provides a link to the full Spark SQL data types documentation and the official PostgreSQL data types for V1 data.

Overall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of the different labels used in the Data Explorer of the Dune Docs project. It helps users understand the meaning of each label and how to identify specific data sets. The guide also provides links to additional resources for more information on data types.
