# Data Explorer Labels

This technical guide covers the various labels encountered while using the Data Explorer in the Dune Docs project. The guide is divided into four sections: Blockchain Icons, Dataset Icons, Dataset Labels, and Data Type Labels.

The Blockchain Icons section provides a table of icons and their descriptions for each blockchain available in the data sets. For instance, the Ethereum blockchain icon represents raw data, decoded project, or spell for Ethereum blockchain. 

The Dataset Icons section provides a table of icons and their descriptions for each dataset. For example, the table icon represents data table (raw data, spell, or smart contract event or function), while the decoded project icon represents a decoded project (protocol or protocol version, e.g., "opensea" or "aave_v2").

The Dataset Labels section provides a table of labels and their descriptions for each dataset. For instance, the project label represents a spell set for a specific project, e.g., `aave`, while the sector label represents a spell set for a sector, e.g., `dex`.

The Data Type Labels section provides a table of labels and their descriptions for each data type. For example, the string label represents character sequences of any length greater or equal to 0, while the long label represents 8-byte signed integer numbers.

Overall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive understanding of the various labels encountered while using the Data Explorer in the Dune Docs project. 

Example: 

If a user encounters the Ethereum blockchain icon while using the Data Explorer, they can understand that the data set contains raw data, decoded project, or spell for the Ethereum blockchain. Similarly, if a user encounters the project label, they can understand that the data set represents a spell set for a specific project, such as `aave`.
