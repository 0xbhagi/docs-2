# Queries

The Queries section of the Dune Docs app technical guide provides an overview of the Query Editor feature in Dune. The Query Editor is a tool that allows users to input SQL code and run it to retrieve data from the blockchain and other sources. The guide is broken down into several sub-sections, each of which covers a different aspect of the Query Editor.

The first sub-section, The Data Explorer, is focused on helping users search for blockchain and other data to use in their Queries. This feature allows users to explore the data available in Dune and select the data they want to use in their Queries.

The second sub-section, The Query Window, is where users input their SQL code and run it. This section provides an overview of how to use the Query Window and includes examples of SQL code that can be used to retrieve data from the blockchain.

The third sub-section, Query Results, is where users can view the data their Query returns after they run it. This section provides an overview of how to interpret the Query Results and includes examples of how to use the data in other parts of the Dune app.

The fourth sub-section, Parameters, is a specialized feature of Dune that allows users to implement variables in certain parts of their Query code. This section provides an overview of how to use Parameters and includes examples of how to implement them in SQL code.

The final sub-section, Query Tips, is a collection of tips to help users master Query creation with Dune. This section provides best practices for creating Queries and includes examples of how to optimize Query performance.

Overall, the Queries section of the Dune Docs app technical guide is a comprehensive guide to using the Query Editor feature in Dune. It provides users with the information they need to create effective Queries and retrieve data from the blockchain and other sources.
