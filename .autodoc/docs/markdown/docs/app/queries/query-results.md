# Query Results

The Query Results section of the Dune Docs app is where users can view the data their Query returns after running it. The guide explains how to get the results of a Query by clicking the "Run" button in the orange box below the Query Window. After a short time, the Query Results will appear as a table. The guide also warns users that queries run on the database they've currently selected in the Data Explorer dropdown. If a user runs a Query that uses Dune V1 Ethereum data, it will fail to run if they select another V1 Blockchain dataset or Dune V2.

The guide explains the elements above the Results table, which include the "Query Results" tab, the "New Visualization" button, "Last run" and "Last run took" times, and the "Run" button. The "New Visualization" button lets users make Visualizations out of their Query data. The guide also explains how to save a Query, and after running a Query at least once, the "Save" button appears above the Query Window. Users can give their Query a name and make it private if they're a Dune Premium user. 

The guide also explains how to re-run a Query, format Results tables, and make Visualizations out of Query Results. Users can change the formatting and appearance of their Query Results tables with the options below the table. The guide explains the different column settings, including Title, Align, Format, Hide column, Colored positive values, and Colored negative values. The guide also provides a table that shows the different column number formatting options. 

Overall, the Query Results guide provides a detailed explanation of how to use the Query Results section of the Dune Docs app. It covers everything from running a Query to formatting Results tables and making Visualizations out of Query Results. The guide is a useful resource for users who want to get the most out of the Query Results section.
