The `docs/reference/wizard-tools` folder contains a collection of guides and resources that are essential for data analysts and scientists working with Dune Analytics. These guides cover various aspects of blockchain analysis, data visualization, and query building, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the tools and techniques used in the field.

The `blockchain-explorers.md` guide offers an overview of the primary web-based explorers for popular blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and more. These explorers are crucial for understanding how certain protocols work and what data needs to be included in queries. For example, a data analyst can use the Etherscan explorer to retrieve data about transactions, addresses, blocks, and fees on the Ethereum blockchain.

The `helpful-dashboards.md` guide lists tutorial and reference dashboards that can help users learn Dune, Data Analytics, and Blockchain Analysis skills. Tutorial Dashboards, such as Tips and Tricks for Dune V2 Queries and Visualizations, provide valuable insights for learning new skills. Reference Dashboards, like Meta Monitoring, offer useful information for building queries more efficiently.

The `index.md` guide covers non-Dune tools that are helpful for learning about ERC-xxx standards, EVM resources, smart contract auditing, and blockchain data sleuthing. Resources like OpenZeppelin's ERC-xxx Standards Docs, Solidity Visual Developer for VS Code, and DeepDAO provide users with a comprehensive understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts.

The `utility-queries.md` guide provides a list of queries that can be used as a starting point for building custom queries. These queries are categorized using tags such as "decoding", "query starting point", "NFT", and "parameters". For instance, the "Is my Contract decoded yet" queries can be used to check if a contract has been decoded on different networks like Polygon, xDAI, and BSC.

Overall, the guides and resources in the `wizard-tools` folder are invaluable for data analysts and scientists working with Dune Analytics. They offer a comprehensive understanding of blockchain analysis, data visualization, and query building, enabling users to create efficient and accurate queries for their projects.
