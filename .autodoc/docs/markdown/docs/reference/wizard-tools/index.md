# Wizard Tools

This section of the app technical guide covers some of the non-Dune tools that the wizards use to make their magic happen. The tools listed here are helpful for learning about ERC-xxx standards, EVM resources, smart contract auditing, blockchain data sleuthing, and more. 

Some of the tools listed include OpenZepplin's ERC-xxx Standards Docs, which are helpful for learning how each ERC-xxx standard works. The EVM Handbook is a curated list of EVM resources for aspiring blockchain data analysts. Solidity Visual Developer for VS Code is a helpful suite of tools for smart contract auditing inside of VS code. Deth.net is a set of Ethereum developer tools that help with blockchain data sleuthing. 

ZK Zhao's map of the Crypto Data Landscape is helpful for getting a sense of the current crypto data ecosystem. His Chaininsight tool is pretty cool too, and could help you build the next trending dashboard before someone else does. 

Other tools listed include DeepDAO, which provides stats on DAOs and their treasuries, and DethCode, which lets you go into an Ethereum smart contract's code to read the comments or the actual logic to help understand the smart contract's emitted data. 

There are also resources for learning about Solidity, such as freeCodeCamp's Learn Solidity Handbook and Ethernaut, a wargame where you "hack" a set of smart contracts. Advanced Ethereum Mini Courses assume you have an understanding of Solidity, React, Truffle, and Web3, but are a good resource for understanding how theory applies to practice. 

Finally, the Online Ethereum Transaction Decoder is a tool that can be used to decode Ethereum transactions. 

Overall, this section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive list of tools and resources that can be used to learn about and work with Ethereum and smart contracts.
