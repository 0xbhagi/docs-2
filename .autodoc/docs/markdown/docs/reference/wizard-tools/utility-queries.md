# Utility Queries

This section of the Dune Docs project provides a list of queries that can help users build their own queries. The queries are organized in a table that includes the name/link and tag of each query. Users can propose changes to the list by following the link provided.

The queries listed in this section are focused on decoding contracts, starting points for queries, and NFTs. For example, the "Is my Contract decoded yet" queries by @0xBoxer and @chenxiangli are focused on decoding contracts on different networks (Ethereum, Polygon, xDAI, and BSC). These queries can be used to check if a contract has been decoded yet, which can be useful for developers who want to analyze the contract's data.

The queries by @ilemi are focused on providing starting points for queries related to common event signatures, functions called by signers, and functions called in traces for a contract. These queries can be used as a foundation for more complex queries that require this information.

Finally, the query by @ilemi for getting all NFTs held by an address (ERC721 + ERC1155) is focused on NFTs. This query can be used to retrieve information about the NFTs held by a specific address, which can be useful for analyzing NFT markets.

Overall, this section of the Dune Docs project provides a useful list of queries that can help users build their own queries. The queries are focused on decoding contracts, starting points for queries, and NFTs, and can be used as a foundation for more complex queries.
