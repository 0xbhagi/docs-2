# Blockchain Explorers

This technical guide provides an overview of Blockchain Explorers, which are essential tools for Data Analysts/Scientists. The guide explains that Blockchain Explorers allow users to explore a blockchain by providing an online interface to retrieve data about transactions, addresses, blocks, and fees, among others. 

The guide lists the primary web-based explorers for the most popular blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche C-Chain, Binance Smart Chain, and Gnosis Chain. Each blockchain is accompanied by a link to its respective explorer. 

The guide emphasizes that while Blockchain Explorers may not offer the same level of functionality as Dune, they are indispensable for understanding how certain protocols work and what data is required for queries. 

For example, the Ethereum blockchain is explored using Etherscan, which provides a comprehensive view of the Ethereum network, including real-time data on transactions, blocks, and addresses. Similarly, Solscan is used to explore the Solana blockchain, while Arbiscan is used for the Arbitrum blockchain. 

Overall, this technical guide provides a useful introduction to Blockchain Explorers and their importance in the world of data analysis and science.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this app and how does it relate to blockchain data analysis?
- The app is a collection of web-based blockchain explorers for popular blockchains, which allow data analysts/scientists to retrieve information about transactions, addresses, blocks, and fees. 

2. Are there any other blockchains that this app supports besides the ones listed?
- The app only lists the primary web-based explorers for the most popular blockchains, so it's possible that there are other blockchains not included in this list. 

3. Does this app provide any tools or features beyond just retrieving blockchain data?
- The app does not provide any tools or features beyond retrieving blockchain data, but it is noted that the explorers listed are not as comprehensive as the Dune platform.
