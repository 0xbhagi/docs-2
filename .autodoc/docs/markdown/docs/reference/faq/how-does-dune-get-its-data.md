# Overview

This app technical guide provides an explanation of how Dune, a project focused on blockchain data analysis, obtains its data. The guide explains that Dune works with node providers across the industry to ingest raw historical data from various blockchains. The guide also clarifies that state data is not included in the data obtained by Dune. 

# How Dune Gets Its Data

The guide explains that Dune collaborates with node providers to obtain data from various blockchains. This data is then ingested into Dune's database. The guide emphasizes that Dune does not discriminate against any smart contract and that users can submit any contract via the decoding page. The only prerequisite for this is an ABI so that Dune can decode the contract. 

# Example

For instance, if a user wants to work with a smart contract on Dune, they can submit the contract via the decoding page. Dune will then decode the contract using the ABI and ingest the data into its database. This allows users to work with the contract in a matter of hours. 

Overall, this guide provides a clear explanation of how Dune obtains its data and highlights the importance of ABIs in the process. It is a useful resource for anyone looking to understand the data acquisition process in Dune.
