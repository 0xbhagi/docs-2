By referring to this guide, users can save time and effort in trying to implement a feature that is not available in the app.

2. **Does Dune have an API?**: This guide informs users that Dune has an API and provides instructions on how to obtain access to it. Users interested in using Dune's API can refer to this guide to learn about the API and how to gain access. They can then follow the provided link to learn more about using the API and refer to additional documentation as needed. For users without API access, they can still export results as CSV or embed Dune charts on their page for free.

3. **How often do results get refreshed?**: This guide explains how Dune keeps results up to date and ensures that dashboards are always displaying the most recent data. Users can refer to this guide to understand how results get refreshed in the app and check the Meta Monitoring dashboard to see if there are any delays in adding new data to Dune. This information is helpful for users who want to ensure that their dashboards are always displaying the most accurate and up-to-date information.

4. **How does Dune get its data?**: This guide provides an explanation of how Dune obtains its data from various blockchains by collaborating with node providers. Users can refer to this guide to understand the data acquisition process in Dune and learn about the importance of ABIs in the process. For example, if a user wants to work with a smart contract on Dune, they can submit the contract via the decoding page, and Dune will decode the contract using the ABI and ingest the data into its database.

Overall, the guides in the FAQ folder provide valuable information for users who are curious about various aspects of the Dune app. These guides can help users better understand the app's features and how to use them effectively, ultimately enhancing their experience with the Dune project.
