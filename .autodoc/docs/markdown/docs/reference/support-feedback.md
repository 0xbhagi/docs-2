The app technical guide titled "Support & Feedback" provides users with information on how to get support and leave feedback for the Dune app. The guide is divided into two main sections: "How to Get Support" and "How to Leave Feedback." 

Under "How to Get Support," users are provided with two options for getting help. The first option is to use the search bar located above the guide to search for answers. The second option is to join the Dune Discord server and ask for help in one of the relevant support channels. The guide lists seven different channels, each with a specific focus, such as query questions, data tables, and API-related questions. 

Under "How to Leave Feedback," users are provided with three different channels for leaving feedback. The first channel is the Canny board, where users can leave general feedback about the Dune app. The second channel is the "bugs" channel in the Dune Discord server, where users can report any bugs they encounter. The third channel is the "feature-requests" channel, where users can suggest new features for the app. 

The guide also provides information on how to report issues related to user accounts, billing, or other administrative problems. Users are instructed to send an email to the support team at support@dune.com. 

Overall, this guide is a helpful resource for users who need assistance with the Dune app or want to provide feedback. The guide provides clear instructions on how to get help and leave feedback, and it directs users to the appropriate channels for their specific needs. The guide also includes helpful visuals, such as a screenshot of the pencil icon users can click to submit feedback fixes or additions.
