The Dune Bounties technical guide is a comprehensive guide that explains how Dune Analytics empowers projects and Wizards to collaborate through incentive-based analytics tasks. The guide is divided into several sections, each of which provides detailed information on a specific aspect of the Dune Bounties project. 

The guide starts by introducing Dune Analytics as a go-to solution for on-demand crypto analytics. It then highlights the problem of Wizards and Projects not being able to find each other and the lack of organization in analytics tasks. The solution to this problem is the creation of a marketplace that can handle task creation, application process, communication, reputation, and payments. 

The guide then introduces Dune Bounties, which is a bounty board that manages Dune internal bounty programs and is accessible to other projects and organizations. Dune Bounties leverages dework.xyz, which is a web3 native Trello with payments and credentialing. The guide provides detailed instructions on how to use Dune Bounties for both projects and Wizards. 

The guide also explains the two parts of Dune, the App Layer, and the Data Layer. The App Layer contains Queries, Visualizations, and Dashboards, while the Data Layer allows Wizards to produce scalable and persistent work by standardizing and normalizing data. The guide recommends working in the Data Layer first to take care of data engineering before building cool stuff in the App Layer to surface findings. 

The guide also provides a FAQ section that answers common questions about Dune Bounties, such as how much to pay Wizards, whether Dune takes a cut of bounty payments, and how to choose the right applicant. 

Overall, the Dune Bounties technical guide is a comprehensive guide that provides detailed information on how to use Dune Bounties for both projects and Wizards. It explains the problem of Wizards and Projects not being able to find each other and the lack of organization in analytics tasks and provides a solution to this problem. The guide also provides detailed instructions on how to use Dune Bounties and how to work in the App Layer and the Data Layer.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of Dune Bounties and how does it relate to blockchain data analysis?
   
   Dune Bounties is a marketplace that connects projects in need of web3 analytics with Wizards who want jobs. It allows for task creation, application process, communication, reputation, and payments, and is web3 native. Blockchain SQL analysts might be interested in using this platform to find work or to offer their services to projects in need of analytics.

2. How does Dune's Data Layer work and why is it important for blockchain data analysis?
   
   Dune's Data Layer, called Spellbook, allows for scalable and persistent work by standardizing and normalizing data. It enables Wizards to easily work with data as it's cleaned and standardized, and to reference it in other Spellbook tables. This is important for blockchain data analysis because it makes it easier to work with large amounts of data and to build on top of existing work.

3. How does Dune Bounties handle payments and what is the recommended approach for organizing bounties for a project's needs?
   
   Dune Bounties uses Dework's native payment feature, where Wizards simply connect their wallet in their Dework profile and get paid as soon as the bounty is paid out by the Project that created the task. The recommended approach for organizing bounties for a project's needs is to first run specific tasks for adding data to Spellbook, then run a Dashboard design contest using Dework's "multiple submissions" feature.
