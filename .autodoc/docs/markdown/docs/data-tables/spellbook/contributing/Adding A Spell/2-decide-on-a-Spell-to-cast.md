This app technical guide covers the process of deciding on a Spell to cast in the Dune app. The guide provides three ways to decide on a Spell, including having an idea based on previous experience with Dune, checking out Spellbook bounties in Dework, or asking for suggestions in the #spellbook Discord channel. 

The guide then provides an example of creating a migration Spell, specifically translating the Keep3r network `view_job_log` abstraction from Dune's v1 database into a V2 Spell. The guide directs the user to find the `view_job_log.sql` file in the `deprecated-dune-v1-abstractions` folder within VSCode. 

The guide also includes a note that Dune V1 Abstractions have been moved to a new repository and provides a link to access the code for migrating a V1 Abstraction to a Spell. The guide concludes by instructing the user to set up the file structure for the Spell's SQL schema and source files.

Overall, this guide provides a clear and concise explanation of how to decide on a Spell and create a migration Spell in the Dune app. The example provided helps to illustrate the process and make it more accessible to users.
