The app technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of Spellbook, an open-source dbt repository for creating and maintaining high-level blockchain data tables using SQL and Jinja templating. The guide explains how Spellbook enables the community to build towards a standardized way to transform data into meaningful abstraction layers. The guide also highlights the importance of Spellbook in making blockchain data more transparent, accessible, and meaningful together. 

The guide provides a step-by-step process of how to cast a Spell, which includes setting up Spellbook dbt, deciding on a Spell to cast, setting up a file structure for SQL, schema, and source files, identifying and defining sources, defining expectations with schema and tests, writing a Spell as a SELECT statement, configuring alias and materialization strategy, and making a pull request to become an Archwizard. 

The guide also provides examples of how to use Spellbook to aggregate and organize raw data from multiple sources to make it much easier to query. For instance, the nft.trades Spell enables users to see industry-wide stats like total volume by # of txs and $USD, 24-hr volume, 24-hour and 7-day growth, market share by marketplace, volume by marketplace, and transaction count by marketplace. 

Overall, the app technical guide provides a detailed explanation of Spellbook and how to cast a Spell, making it easier for users to create and maintain high-level blockchain data tables using SQL and Jinja templating.
## Questions: 
 1. What is Spellbook and how does it relate to blockchain data analytics?
- Spellbook is an open-source dbt repository for creating and maintaining high-level blockchain data tables using SQL and Jinja templating. It enables the community to build toward a standardized way to transform data into meaningful abstraction layers, making it much easier to query blockchain data.

2. How does Spellbook save time and effort in blockchain data analysis?
- Spellbook allows users to create abstracted data sets, like dex.trades and nft.trades, which aggregate and organize raw data from multiple sources. This saves time and effort in data analysis as users can skip the manual abstraction work and get straight to the insights.

3. How can a blockchain SQL analyst contribute to Spellbook?
- A blockchain SQL analyst can contribute to Spellbook by doing the data engineering for a new marketplace, submitting a Pull Request to Spellbook, and having the entire community benefit from their work. They can also follow the 8 steps outlined in the app technical guide to create and maintain high-level blockchain data tables using SQL and Jinja templating.
