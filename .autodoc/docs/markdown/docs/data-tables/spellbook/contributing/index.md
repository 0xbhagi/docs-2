# Spellbook Technical Guide

This technical guide is focused on the Spellbook feature of the Dune Docs project. The Spellbook is a collection of how-to guides for creating and using Spells, which are essentially SQL queries that can be saved and reused. 

## Casting a Spell from scratch

This section provides a link to a guide on how to add a Spell to the Spellbook. The guide is located in the `contributing/Adding A Spell` folder and is intended for users who want to learn by doing. The guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a new Spell and add it to the Spellbook.

## Spellbook on GitHub

This section provides a link to the Spellbook repository on GitHub. Users who want to take a look under the hood can find the source code for the Spellbook here. The repository contains a variety of how-to guides for creating Spells.

## Video Guides

This section provides links to two video guides on how to use the Spellbook. The first video is a DuneCon workshop presented by Megan Heintz, a member of the Dune Team who came up with the name "Spellbook". The workshop provides an overview of the Spellbook's infrastructure and demonstrates how to migrate data to a Spell. The second video is a tutorial presented by Andrew Hong, who shows how to create a pair, manage liquidity, swap through pairs, and pull and transform data on Ethereum using Spells.

Overall, this technical guide provides users with resources for learning how to use the Spellbook feature of the Dune Docs project. Users can follow step-by-step guides, explore the source code on GitHub, or watch video tutorials to learn how to create and use Spells.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Spellbook app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?
    
    The app technical guide does not provide clear information on the purpose of the Spellbook app or its relation to blockchain technology, so a blockchain SQL analyst might have to do further research or seek clarification from the developers.

2. Are there any security measures in place to protect user data and transactions within the app?

    The app technical guide does not mention any security measures in place to protect user data and transactions, so a blockchain SQL analyst might have to investigate further or consult with the developers to ensure the app is secure.

3. What programming languages and frameworks were used to develop the Spellbook app?

    The app technical guide does not provide information on the programming languages and frameworks used to develop the Spellbook app, so a blockchain SQL analyst might have to do further research or consult with the developers to determine the technology stack.
