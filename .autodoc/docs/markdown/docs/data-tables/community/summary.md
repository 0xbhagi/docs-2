The `docs/data-tables/community` folder contains a comprehensive app technical guide for the Community section of the Dune Docs project. This section focuses on providing additional data insights through partnerships with third-party data providers, such as Flashbots and Reservoir. The guide is organized into different sections, each covering a specific aspect of the project, such as availability, purpose, and data providers.

For example, the `index.md` file provides an overview of the Community section, its availability on the V2 Engine, and its purpose in providing off-chain data or augmented on-chain data. This guide helps users understand the importance of the Community section and how it can provide additional insights through partnerships with selected organizations.

The guide also covers two data providers currently featured in the Community section: Flashbots and Reservoir. Each provider has its own subfolder with more detailed information about the data they provide. For instance, the `flashbots` subfolder contains various files that cover different aspects of the Flashbots project, such as arbitrages, liquidations, mev_summary, sandwiched swaps, and sandwiches. These guides provide clear and concise explanations of the table structures, column descriptions, and query examples that can be used to retrieve information from the tables.

Similarly, the `reservoir` subfolder contains a comprehensive app technical guide for the Reservoir project, which focuses on enabling the next generation of NFT products and liquidity sources through open-source, on-chain NFT order aggregation. The guide is organized into different sections, each covering a specific aspect of the project, such as token attributes, sales, collections, and various events related to bids and asks.

Overall, the Community section of the Dune Docs project serves as a valuable resource for developers and users who want to access additional data insights through partnerships with third-party data providers. The guides provided in this folder offer clear and concise explanations of the table structures, column descriptions, and query examples that can be used to retrieve information from the tables. By using this guide, developers and users can gain a better understanding of how the Community section works and how to use it effectively in their work.
