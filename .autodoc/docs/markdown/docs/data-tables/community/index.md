# Dune Docs App Technical Guide: Community

This section of the Dune Docs project contains data that has been submitted and hosted on Dune by third-party data providers. The purpose of this guide is to provide an overview of the Community section and its features.

## Availability

The Community section is only available on the V2 Engine. It is important to note that this section is still under development, and the infrastructure is being built to support more datasets.

## Purpose

While blockchain data is interesting on its own, sometimes off-chain data or augmented on-chain data is needed as well. The Community section is designed to partner with selected organizations that stream their data directly to Dune. This allows for a more comprehensive view of the data and can provide additional insights.

## Data Providers

The Community section currently features two data providers: Flashbots and Reservoir. Each provider has its own page with more detailed information about the data they provide.

### Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization that focuses on miner-extractable value (MEV) and the fair distribution of this value. Their page on the Community section provides data related to MEV and other metrics.

### Reservoir

Reservoir is a data provider that focuses on Ethereum data. Their page on the Community section provides data related to Ethereum transactions, including gas usage and transaction volume.

It is important to note that these are just two examples of data providers that may be featured in the Community section. As the infrastructure is built out, more providers may be added.

Overall, the Community section of the Dune Docs project is designed to provide additional data insights through partnerships with third-party data providers. While still under development, this section has the potential to provide valuable information to users of the Dune platform.
