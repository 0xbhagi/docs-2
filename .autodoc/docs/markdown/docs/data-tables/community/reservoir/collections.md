# Collections

This section of the app technical guide focuses on the `reservoir.collections` table, which contains records with information about each NFT collection. The table includes various columns such as `id`, `slug`, `name`, `description`, `token_count`, `contract`, `day1_rank`, `day7_rank`, `day30_rank`, `all_time_rank`, `day1_volume`, `day7_volume`, `day30_volume`, `all_time_volume`, `day1_volume_change`, `day7_volume_change`, `day30_volume_change`, `floor_ask_value`, `day1_floor_sale_value`, `day7_floor_sale_value`, `day30_floor_sale_value`, `day1_floor_sale_change`, `day7_floor_sale_change`, `day30_floor_sale_change`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

The purpose of this guide is to provide developers with information on how to query the `reservoir.collections` table and understand the meaning of each column. The guide includes two query examples that can be found at the provided links. 

Developers can use this information to build features that utilize NFT collections, such as displaying information about a specific collection or analyzing trends in NFT trading volume and floor sale prices. For example, a developer could use the `day1_volume` column to display the trading volume of a specific collection over the past day, or use the `floor_ask_value` column to display the current floor sale price of a collection in its native currency.

Overall, this section of the app technical guide provides valuable information for developers looking to work with NFT collections in the Dune Docs project.
