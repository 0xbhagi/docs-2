The `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/data-tables/raw/bitcoin` folder in the Dune Docs project focuses on providing comprehensive guides for working with raw Bitcoin data. This data is organized into four main categories: Blocks, Transactions, Outputs, and Inputs. Each category has a dedicated markdown file that explains the respective feature in detail, including the available data, data types, and how to access and use the data in the Dune Docs app.

For example, the `blocks.md` file covers the `bitcoin.blocks` feature, which provides information about Bitcoin blocks, such as their time, height, date, hash, transaction count, and size. Developers working with Bitcoin blocks can use this feature to display information about recent Bitcoin blocks in their applications, such as a Bitcoin wallet app.

Similarly, the `transactions.md` file provides a detailed guide on the `bitcoin.transactions` feature, which contains information about Bitcoin transactions, including their hash, size, fee, and the number of inputs and outputs. The guide also explains how to work with nested hierarchical data types, such as `input` and `output` fields, which can be useful for developers analyzing transaction patterns or tracking the movement of Bitcoin between addresses.

The `outputs.md` file focuses on the `bitcoin.outputs` table, which contains information about the outputs of Bitcoin transactions. This table can be used to analyze transaction patterns, track the movement of Bitcoin between addresses, and identify potential fraud or money laundering activities.

Lastly, the `inputs.md` file covers the `bitcoin.inputs` feature, which provides a table with detailed information about the inputs of a Bitcoin transaction. Developers can use this feature to display transaction details to users in applications like a Bitcoin wallet app.

Overall, the guides in this folder provide a clear understanding of the raw Bitcoin data available in the Dune Docs project and how to access and use it effectively. By following these guides, developers can build powerful tools for analyzing Bitcoin transactions and blocks, which can be useful in various applications and projects.
