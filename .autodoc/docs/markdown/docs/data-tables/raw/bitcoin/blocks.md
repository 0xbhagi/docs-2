The Blocks section of the app technical guide covers the `bitcoin.blocks` feature of the project. This feature provides information about Bitcoin blocks, including their time, height, date, hash, transaction count, size, and various other details. 

The guide provides a table with a detailed breakdown of each column in the `bitcoin.blocks` feature, including the column name, column type, and a description of what each column represents. For example, the `time` column represents the block time, while the `height` column represents the block number. 

This information is useful for developers who are working with Bitcoin blocks and need to access specific details about them. For example, a developer building a Bitcoin wallet app might use this feature to display information about recent Bitcoin blocks to their users. 

Overall, the Blocks section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `bitcoin.blocks` feature, making it easier for developers to understand and use this feature in their projects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `bitcoin.blocks` table in this app? 
- The `bitcoin.blocks` table contains information about individual blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, including their height, hash, transaction count, and various other metrics.

2. How is the `total_reward` column calculated? 
- The `total_reward` column represents the static reward given to the miner and is calculated as the sum of the outputs in the coinbase transaction (the first transaction).

3. What is the significance of the `difficulty` column? 
- The `difficulty` column represents the estimated amount of work done to find this block relative to the estimated amount of work done to find block 0. It is a measure of the level of difficulty in mining the block and is used to adjust the mining difficulty level of the network.
