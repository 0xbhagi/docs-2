The `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/data-tables/raw/solana` folder contains a comprehensive technical guide for working with Solana's raw data tables. These tables provide valuable insights into various aspects of the Solana blockchain, such as account activity, blocks, rewards, transactions, and vote transactions. This guide is essential for developers and analysts who want to work with Solana's data and understand the structure and contents of these tables.

The `account-activity.md` file covers the `Solana.account_activity` table, which contains information about account usage in transactions. This table can be used to track the usage of a specific account over time and optimize applications based on account activity patterns.

The `blocks.md` file provides information on the `Solana.blocks` table, which contains block data within Solana's blockchain. This table can be used to identify block activity and transaction changes over time. The guide also provides Solana Query examples that can be used with the `Solana.blocks` table.

The `index.md` file serves as an overview of the Solana Technical Guide, providing information on Solana's raw data and how it differs from other chains. It also highlights the changes made to the `solana.account_activity` and `solana.transactions` tables, making it useful for developers who need to understand the updates made to these tables.

The `rewards.md` file covers the `Solana.rewards` table, which contains data about rewards paid out on Solana. This table can be used to analyze trends and patterns in reward distribution, providing valuable insights into the Solana blockchain's reward system.

The `transactions.md` file provides a technical guide for the `Solana.transactions` table, which contains transaction data within Solana's blockchain. The guide includes detailed descriptions of each column and struct type, as well as query examples that demonstrate how to extract data from the table.

Finally, the `vote-transactions.md` file focuses on the `Solana.vote_transactions` table, which contains the full set of vote transactions submitted by validators to vote on a block. This table can be joined with the non-vote transactions table to get a full breakdown of all transactions, providing a comprehensive view of validator voting activity on the Solana blockchain.

Overall, the guide in this folder offers a detailed understanding of Solana's raw data tables and their usage. It is an invaluable resource for developers and analysts working with Solana data, providing examples and explanations that can help them make informed decisions and optimize their applications based on the insights gained from these tables.
