# Transactions

The Transactions section of the Dune Docs project provides a technical guide for the Solana.transactions table, which contains transaction data within Solana's blockchain. The table includes relevant data related to account, protocol, and program activity. The guide provides a detailed description of each column in the table, including the column name, column type, and description. 

The guide also includes query examples that demonstrate how to extract data from the table. For example, the guide provides a query that shows NFT transactions of popular programs in the past seven days and an overview of the drift-protocol. 

The guide also includes definitions for several data types used in the table, including STRUCT, which allows for representing nested hierarchical data and has key-value pairs. The guide provides examples of how to use these data types to extract data from the table. 

The guide also includes definitions for several struct types used in the table, including token_balance, instructions, inner_instructions, and error. Each struct type includes a field, data type, and description. 

Overall, the Transactions section of the Dune Docs project provides a comprehensive technical guide for the Solana.transactions table, including detailed descriptions of each column and struct type, as well as query examples that demonstrate how to extract data from the table.
