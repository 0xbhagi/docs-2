# Raw Tables

The Raw Tables section of the Dune Docs project provides users with raw, unfiltered, and unedited data. This allows users to query for any transaction, block, event log, or trace across the blockchains that Dune supports. Raw data tables are particularly useful for obtaining meta information about the blockchain, a transaction, traces, or certain events.

However, queries that have been written using raw data tables are notoriously hard to understand and audit due to the nature of the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Furthermore, the raw data tables have a very large number of rows and hence can be slow to query. Most of the time, users are better off submitting contracts for decoding and working with decoded data.

## EVM Raw Table Data

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powers all chains in Dune except Solana and Bitcoin, meaning they share the base structure for underlying data. The following are the different types of EVM raw table data available in the Dune Docs project:

- **Blocks**: Blocks are the building blocks of blockchains and rollups.
- **Event Logs**: Event Logs are data that gets generated by smart contracts.
- **Traces**: Traces contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions.
- **Transactions**: Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts.

Overall, the Raw Tables section of the Dune Docs project provides users with a comprehensive guide on how to work with raw data tables. It also highlights the limitations of using raw data tables and suggests alternative methods for working with blockchain data. The section on EVM Raw Table Data provides users with a detailed explanation of the different types of raw data tables available for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and how they can be used.
## Questions: 
 1. What types of blockchain data can be queried using raw tables in Dune Docs?
- Raw tables in Dune Docs allow for querying of any transaction, block, event log, or trace across the blockchains that Dune supports.

2. What are some challenges associated with using raw data tables for queries?
- Queries written using raw data tables can be difficult to understand and audit due to the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Additionally, raw data tables can have a large number of rows and be slow to query.

3. Which blockchains in Dune Docs are powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
- All chains in Dune Docs except for Solana and Bitcoin are powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
