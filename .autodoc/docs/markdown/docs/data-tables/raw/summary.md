The `.autodoc/docs/json/docs/data-tables/raw` folder in the Dune Docs project focuses on providing comprehensive guides for working with raw, unfiltered, and unedited data from various blockchains, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana. This raw data is organized into different categories such as Blocks, Transactions, Event Logs, and Traces. Each category has a dedicated markdown file that explains the respective feature in detail, including the available data, data types, and how to access and use the data in the Dune Docs app.

For example, the `blocks.md` file covers the concept of blocks in blockchains and rollups, providing tables and column data that are useful for identifying block activity and transaction changes over time. Developers working with blockchain data can use this guide to understand how blocks work in the context of the Dune Docs project and extract valuable insights from the data.

Similarly, the `event-logs.md` file provides a detailed guide on the `Event Logs` tables that store all logs data generated by smart contracts. This guide is essential for developers who want to work with event logs and understand the structure and contents of these tables.

The `traces.md` file focuses on the Traces tables, which contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions. This guide is useful for developers analyzing transaction patterns or tracking the movement of assets between addresses.

Lastly, the `transactions.md` file covers transactions in the Ethereum network, including tables and column data. This guide is essential for developers who want to work with transaction data and understand the structure and contents of these tables.

In addition to the Ethereum-focused guides, this folder also contains subfolders for Bitcoin and Solana, providing detailed guides for working with raw data from these blockchains.

Overall, the guides in this folder provide a clear understanding of the raw data available in the Dune Docs project and how to access and use it effectively. By following these guides, developers can build powerful tools for analyzing blockchain transactions and blocks, which can be useful in various applications and projects.
