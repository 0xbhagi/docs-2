The guide in the `functions-and-operators.md` file covers the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by DuneSQL, which is a part of the larger project feature "query." This guide is essential for developers working with DuneSQL to understand the available SQL functions and operators and how to use them effectively in their code. It provides a comprehensive list of functions and operators, categorized by their specific use cases, such as Aggregate, Array, Binary, Bitwise, Color, Comparison, Conditional, Conversion, Date and time, Decimal, Geospatial, HyperLogLog, IP Address, JSON, Lambda, Logical, Machine learning, Map, Math, Quantile digest, Regular expression, Session, Set Digest, String, System, Table, Teradata, T-Digest, URL, UUID, and Window.

For example, if a developer is working on a feature that requires manipulating arrays, they can refer to the Array header in the guide, which provides a link to the Trino documentation on array functions. This will help them understand how to use the available functions to manipulate arrays effectively.

Similarly, if a developer needs to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value, they can refer to the Aggregate header in the guide. This header provides a link to the Trino documentation on aggregate functions, which will help them understand how to use these functions in their code.

The guide also provides information on how to use the SHOW FUNCTIONS command to return a list of all available functions, including custom functions, with all supported arguments and a short description. This can be useful for developers who want to explore the available functions and their usage in their code.

In addition to the categorized list of functions and operators, the guide recommends reviewing the SQL data types and the SQL statement and syntax reference. This will help developers gain a better understanding of the data types they are working with and how to write efficient SQL queries using DuneSQL.

Overall, this guide serves as a valuable reference for developers working with DuneSQL in the larger project feature "query." It helps them understand the available SQL functions and operators, their usage, and how to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources.
