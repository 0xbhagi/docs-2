# Mathematical functions and operators

This technical guide covers the mathematical functions and operators available in the Dune Docs project. The guide is divided into several sections, each of which covers a specific mathematical function or operator. 

The first section covers mathematical operators, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. 

The second section covers mathematical functions, including `abs()`, `cbrt()`, `ceil()`, `ceiling()`, `degrees()`, `e()`, `exp()`, `floor()`, `ln()`, `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`, `mod()`, `pi()`, `pow()`, `power()`, `radians()`, `round()`, `sign()`, `sqrt()`, `truncate()`, and `width_bucket()`. 

The third section covers random functions, including `rand()`, `random()`, and `random(n)`. 

The fourth section covers trigonometric functions, including `acos()`, `asin()`, `atan()`, `atan2()`, `cos()`, `cosh()`, `sin()`, `tan()`, and `tanh()`. 

The fifth section covers floating point functions, including `infinity()`, `is_finite()`, `is_infinite()`, `is_nan()`, and `nan()`. 

The sixth section covers base conversion functions, including `from_base()` and `to_base()`. 

The seventh section covers statistical functions, including `cosine_similarity()`, `wilson_interval_lower()`, and `wilson_interval_upper()`. 

The eighth section covers cumulative distribution functions, including `beta_cdf()`, `inverse_beta_cdf()`, `inverse_normal_cdf()`, and `normal_cdf()`. 

Each function is described in detail, including its input parameters and output format. Examples are provided where appropriate to illustrate how each function can be used. 

Overall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the mathematical functions and operators available in the Dune Docs project, making it a valuable resource for developers working on this project.
