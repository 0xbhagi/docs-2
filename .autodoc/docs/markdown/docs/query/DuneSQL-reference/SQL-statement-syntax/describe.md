This app technical guide covers the `DESCRIBE` command in the Dune Docs project. The `DESCRIBE` command is used to display the structure of a table in a database. The guide provides a synopsis of the command, which is `DESCRIBE table_name`, where `table_name` is the name of the table to be described. 

The guide also explains that `DESCRIBE` is an alias for `show-columns`, which is another command that can be used to display the structure of a table. This information is useful for users who may be more familiar with the `show-columns` command and want to use it instead of `DESCRIBE`.

Overall, this guide provides a clear and concise explanation of the `DESCRIBE` command and its purpose in the Dune Docs project. An example of how to use the command would be:

``` text
DESCRIBE customers
```

This would display the structure of the `customers` table in the database.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `DESCRIBE` command in the context of the dune docs project?
- The app technical guide describes `DESCRIBE` as an alias for `show-columns`, but it is unclear how this command is used within the project.

2. Does the dune docs project use SQL databases, and if so, which ones?
- The `DESCRIBE` command is commonly used in SQL databases, so a blockchain SQL analyst may want to know if the dune docs project uses any SQL databases and which ones specifically.

3. Are there any specific security measures in place to protect the SQL databases used by the dune docs project?
- Since SQL databases can contain sensitive information, a blockchain SQL analyst may want to know if there are any security measures in place to protect the databases used by the dune docs project. The app technical guide does not provide any information on this topic.
