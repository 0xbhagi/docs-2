The "Show Session" section of the app technical guide covers the functionality of listing the current session properties in the Dune Docs app. The `SHOW SESSION` command is used to display the session properties, and an optional `LIKE` clause can be used to filter the results based on a specified pattern. The example provided in the guide shows how to use the `LIKE` clause to find session properties that begin with "query". 

The purpose of this section is to provide users with a way to view the current session properties in the app, which can be useful for troubleshooting or debugging purposes. The guide also references other related commands, such as `reset-session` and `set-session`, which can be used to modify the session properties.

Overall, this section of the guide is focused on the app folder of the Dune Docs project, specifically on the functionality related to managing and viewing session properties.
