# EXPLAIN ANALYZE

The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command is used to execute a statement and show the distributed execution plan of the statement along with the cost of each operation. This command is useful for analyzing the performance of a query and identifying any bottlenecks. 

The `VERBOSE` option provides more detailed information and low-level statistics, which may require knowledge of Trino internals and implementation details. However, it should be noted that the stats may not be entirely accurate, especially for queries that complete quickly.

The guide provides an example of how to use the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command to analyze a query. In the example, the CPU time spent in each stage is shown, as well as the relative cost of each plan node in the stage. For each plan node, additional statistics are provided, such as average input per node instance. These statistics are useful when one wants to detect data anomalies for a query, such as skewness.

When the `VERBOSE` option is used, some operators may report additional information. For example, the window function operator will output additional metrics such as CPU time distribution, input rows distribution, and scheduled time distribution.

Overall, the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command is a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of a query and identifying any bottlenecks. By providing detailed information about the execution plan and cost of each operation, it allows developers to optimize their queries and improve the overall performance of their application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement in this app?
- The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement is used to execute a query and show the distributed execution plan of the statement along with the cost of each operation.

2. What is the `VERBOSE` option and when might it be useful?
- The `VERBOSE` option provides more detailed information and low-level statistics, which may be useful for understanding Trino internals and implementation details. It might be useful when trying to detect data anomalies for a query.

3. Are the stats generated by `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` always accurate?
- No, the stats may not be entirely accurate, especially for queries that complete quickly.
