The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\spellbook\top tables` folder contains technical guides for various features of the Dune Docs project, specifically focusing on data tables and their usage. These guides are essential for analysts working with different aspects of the project, such as token transfers, metadata, prices, address labels, and NFT trades.

For example, the `dex.trades.md` guide provides an overview of the dex.trades feature, which aggregates data across multiple decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms into one simple table. This guide is useful for users who want to query trading data for their favorite tokens without dealing with different DEX smart contracts.

The `labels.md` guide covers the Address Labels feature on Dune, explaining what labels are, how to add them, and how to use them. This guide is helpful for users who want to label addresses based on specific criteria, such as usage of a certain dapp or holding a certain amount of a token.

The `nft.trades.md` guide provides a comprehensive overview of the effort to make NFT trading data easily available on Dune. This guide is useful for users who want to retrieve data from the `nft.trades` table, such as all trades for a given NFT or platform volumes in the last year.

The `prices.md` guide covers the `Prices` feature, which allows users to get the price of almost all relevant ERC20 tokens. This guide is helpful for users who want to use the `prices.usd` and `prices_from_dex_data` tables to get token prices and understand the limitations of each table.

Lastly, the `tokens.md` guide focuses on token transfers and metadata for both fungible (erc20) and non-fungible (erc721 and erc1155) tokens. This guide is essential for analysts working with tokens, as it covers metadata and transfer tables, as well as a guide on how to calculate native token balances.

Overall, the guides in this folder provide valuable information for analysts working with various aspects of the Dune Docs project. They offer detailed explanations, examples, and insights into how these features fit into the larger project and how they can be used effectively.
