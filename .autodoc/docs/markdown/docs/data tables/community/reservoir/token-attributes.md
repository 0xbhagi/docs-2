# Token Attributes

This section of the app technical guide covers the `reservoir.token_attributes` table, which contains records with information about each NFT token attribute. The table has several columns, including `id`, `contract`, `token_id`, `attribute_id`, `collection_id`, `key`, `value`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. 

The `id` column is an internal token attribute ID, while the `contract` column contains the contract address. The `token_id` column contains the ID of the token in the collection, and the `attribute_id` column is an internal attribute ID. The `collection_id` column contains the internal collection ID, while the `key` column contains the attribute name. The `value` column contains the attribute value, and the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns contain timestamps for when the token attribute was created and updated, respectively.

The guide provides a query example for this table, which can be found at [https://dune.com/queries/1302940/2232326](https://dune.com/queries/1302940/2232326). This query can be used to retrieve information from the `reservoir.token_attributes` table.

Overall, this section of the app technical guide provides information about the `reservoir.token_attributes` table and its columns. It is useful for developers who are working on the app's NFT token attributes functionality.
