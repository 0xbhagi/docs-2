The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\community` folder contains documentation for the Community section of the Dune Docs project, which focuses on providing off-chain data or augmented on-chain data submitted by third-party data providers. This section is essential for developers and analysts who need additional data beyond blockchain data for their projects. Currently, the Community section is only available on V2 Engine, and more datasets will be added in the future.

The folder contains two subfolders, `flashbots` and `reservoir`, which provide documentation for the Flashbots and Reservoir datasets, respectively. The Flashbots project deals with Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and its impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. The `flashbots` folder contains guides for various data tables related to MEV strategies, such as arbitrages, liquidations, and sandwiched swaps. These guides help developers and analysts understand the structure and usage of these tables, enabling them to analyze and understand the impact of MEV on the Ethereum ecosystem effectively.

For example, the `arbitrages.md` guide in the `flashbots` folder covers the `flashbots.arbitrages` table, which contains information about arbitrage trades. Developers can use this guide to understand the table structure and query it effectively.

The Reservoir dataset focuses on the Reservoir feature of the Dune Docs project, an open-source, on-chain NFT order aggregation tool. The `reservoir` folder provides detailed explanations of various tables, their columns, and their purposes, as well as query examples for retrieving specific information from these tables. This documentation is essential for developers working with NFT collections, sales, and attributes in the Dune app.

For instance, the `reservoir.sales` table guide provides a clear understanding of the table structure and contents, as well as examples of how to query the data. Developers can use this guide to work with sales data in the Dune Docs project effectively.

In summary, the `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\community` folder provides essential documentation for developers and analysts who need additional off-chain or augmented on-chain data for their projects. By following the guides in this folder, users can effectively work with the Flashbots and Reservoir datasets, analyze their data, and integrate them into their projects.
