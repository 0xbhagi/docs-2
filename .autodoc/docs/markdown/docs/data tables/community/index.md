# Community

This section of the Dune Docs project contains data that has been submitted and hosted on Dune by third-party data providers. The purpose of this section is to provide off-chain data or augmented on-chain data that may be needed in addition to blockchain data. 

The section is only available on V2 Engine. The guide notes that the infrastructure for this endeavor is still being built, and therefore, the support for more datasets is not available at the moment. 

The section contains two datasets, Flashbots and Reservoir, which are listed as cards in a grid format. The purpose of these datasets is not explained in this guide, but they are linked to their respective index pages where more information about them can be found. 

The guide is short and straightforward, providing a brief overview of the Community section and its purpose. It also notes that the section is only available on V2 Engine and that more datasets will be added in the future. 

Example:

If a user needs off-chain data or augmented on-chain data in addition to blockchain data, they can visit the Community section of the Dune Docs project. They will find two datasets, Flashbots and Reservoir, which they can explore further by clicking on the links to their respective index pages. However, they should note that the section is only available on V2 Engine and that more datasets will be added in the future.
