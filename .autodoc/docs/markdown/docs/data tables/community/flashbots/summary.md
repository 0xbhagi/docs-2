The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\community\flashbots` folder contains documentation for the Flashbots project, which focuses on Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and its impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. The folder includes guides for various data tables related to MEV strategies, such as arbitrages, liquidations, and sandwiched swaps. These guides are essential for developers and analysts working with Flashbots data and aim to provide a better understanding of the structure and usage of these tables.

For instance, the `arbitrages.md` guide covers the `flashbots.arbitrages` table, which contains information about arbitrage trades. It explains the purpose of the table, its columns, and provides a query example to retrieve information on arbitrage trades. This guide is useful for developers who need to understand the structure of the table and how to query it effectively.

Similarly, the `liquidations.md` guide focuses on the `flashbots.liquidations` table, which contains details related to executed liquidations. It provides a query example called "Liquidations by Protocol" that demonstrates how to use the table to analyze liquidation data.

The `mev_summary.md` guide covers the `mev_summary` table, which provides a summary of all classified transactions. This table is crucial for analyzing and understanding the MEV ecosystem. The guide includes a query example called "Miner Revenue from Liquidations and Arbitrages" that demonstrates how to use the table to analyze miner revenue.

The `sandwiched-swaps.md` guide explains the `flashbots.sandwiched_swaps` table, which contains data about sandwiched swaps. It provides query examples for retrieving data from the table using SQL queries. This guide is helpful for developers working with sandwiched swap data in the Dune Docs app.

Lastly, the `sandwiches.md` guide covers the `sandwiches` table, which contains detailed information about executed sandwiches. It provides an example of how to query the table to retrieve all sandwiches executed by a specific sandwicher.

Overall, the guides in this folder are essential for developers and analysts working with Flashbots data and aim to provide a better understanding of the structure and usage of the various data tables related to MEV strategies. By following these guides, users can effectively analyze and understand the impact of MEV on the Ethereum ecosystem.
