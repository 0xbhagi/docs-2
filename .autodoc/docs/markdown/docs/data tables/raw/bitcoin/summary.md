The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\raw\bitcoin` folder contains a comprehensive app technical guide for working with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. The guide is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Bitcoin data, such as blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs.

The `blocks.md` file provides a detailed description of the `bitcoin.blocks` table, which contains information about each block in the Bitcoin blockchain. This section is useful for developers who need to understand the structure of the `bitcoin.blocks` table and retrieve information about specific blocks, such as their size or the number of transactions they contain.

The `index.md` file serves as an introduction to the app technical guide, providing an overview of the different types of Bitcoin data available in the Dune Docs project. This file is a useful starting point for users who are new to Bitcoin and want to learn more about the data types and how to work with them.

The `inputs.md` file focuses on the `bitcoin.inputs` table, which contains information related to the inputs of Bitcoin transactions. This section is valuable for developers who need to understand the structure of the `bitcoin.inputs` table and work with input data, such as the value of an input or the block time of the block containing the input.

The `outputs.md` file provides a detailed guide on the `bitcoin.outputs` data table, which includes information about the outputs of Bitcoin transactions. This section is helpful for developers working with output data, such as retrieving the block time and date of a specific output or identifying the address type of an output.

Finally, the `transactions.md` file offers a comprehensive overview of the `bitcoin.transactions` feature, including the various columns and structures that make up the transaction table. This guide is a valuable resource for developers working with transaction data, such as analyzing transaction fees or working with nested hierarchical data in the input and output columns.

Overall, the app technical guide in this folder is an essential resource for developers and analysts working with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. It provides a clear understanding of the different data types and structures, making it easier to build queries, analyze data, and integrate the information into various applications.
