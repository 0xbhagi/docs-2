# Event Logs

This technical guide covers the `Event Logs` tables in the Dune Docs project. These tables store all logs data that gets generated by smart contracts. The purpose of this guide is to provide an understanding of how event logs work and how they can be useful for querying contracts that are not yet decoded or are not able to be decoded since the code of the smart contract is not public.

The guide explains that logs are an elegant way to store tiny amounts of data on EVM blockchains for a small amount of gas. Specifically, event logs are useful to let other people know something has happened without them having to query contracts individually. The guide also provides a link to an article for more information on this topic.

The guide then provides two tables that show the different chains and tables that are available in the Dune Docs project. The first table shows the V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and the second table shows the V1 Engine (PosgreSQL). Each table lists the chain, table, and any notes that may be relevant.

Finally, the guide provides a detailed description of the column data that is available in the Event Logs tables. The description includes the column name, data type, and a brief explanation of what the column represents. An example is also provided to help users understand how the data is structured.

Overall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Event Logs tables in the Dune Docs project. It explains how event logs work, how they can be useful, and provides detailed information on the available data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Event Logs tables in this app and how are they useful for blockchain analysis?
   
   The Event Logs tables store all logs data generated by smart contracts and are useful for querying contracts that are not yet decoded or are not able to be decoded since the code of the smart contract is not public. They are also useful for letting other people know something has happened without them having to query contracts individually.

2. What engines are used for this app and what are the differences between them?
   
   The app uses two engines: V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PosgreSQL). The main difference between them is the type of SQL used: Spark SQL for V2 and PostgreSQL for V1.

3. What kind of data is stored in the Event Logs tables and what are some examples of the columns?
   
   The Event Logs tables store data such as the contract address, keccak256 hash of a flattened event declaration string, indexed topics of the event, unindexed data containing further information on the event, transaction hash, block hash, block number, block time, and index position of the log and transaction in the block. An example of the columns can be found in the table under the "Column Data" section of the app technical guide.
