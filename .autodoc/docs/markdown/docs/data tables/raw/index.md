# Raw Tables

The Raw Tables section of the Dune Docs project provides raw, unfiltered, and unedited data for querying transactions, blocks, event logs, or traces across the blockchains that Dune supports. This section is useful for obtaining meta information about the blockchain, a transaction, traces, or certain events. However, queries written using raw data tables can be difficult to understand and audit due to the nature of the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Additionally, raw data tables have a large number of rows, which can make querying slow. Therefore, it is often better to submit contracts for decoding and work with decoded data.

The EVM Raw Table Data section focuses on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which powers all chains in Dune except Solana and Bitcoin. This section includes the following subtopics:

- Blocks: Blocks are the building blocks of blockchains and rollups.
- Event Logs: Event Logs are data generated by smart contracts.
- Traces: Traces contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions.
- Transactions: Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts.

Each subtopic provides detailed information on how to query the specific data type. For example, the Blocks subtopic explains how to query block data, including block number, timestamp, and miner address. The Event Logs subtopic explains how to query event logs, including the event name, contract address, and event parameters.

Overall, the Raw Tables section of the Dune Docs project provides a comprehensive guide for querying raw data tables and understanding the encoded data commonly found in these tables. It also provides guidance on when it is better to work with decoded data and how to query specific data types within the EVM Raw Table Data section.
## Questions: 
 1. What types of blockchain data can be queried using raw tables in Dune Docs?
- Raw tables in Dune Docs allow for querying of any transaction, block, event log, or trace across the blockchains that Dune supports.

2. What are some challenges associated with querying raw data tables?
- Queries written using raw data tables can be difficult to understand and audit due to the encoded data commonly found in these tables. Additionally, raw data tables have a large number of rows and can be slow to query.

3. Which blockchains in Dune Docs are powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
- All chains in Dune Docs except for Solana and Bitcoin are powered by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
