The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\raw\solana` folder contains a comprehensive technical guide for various Solana data tables, which are essential for developers and analysts working with Solana blockchain data. These guides provide detailed information on the structure, columns, and data types of the tables, as well as examples of how to use them in queries and analysis.

For instance, the `account-activity.md` guide focuses on the `Solana.account_activity` table, which contains information about account usage in transactions. This guide is particularly useful for developers who want to retrieve information about an account's usage in a transaction, as it provides a clear understanding of the table and its columns.

Similarly, the `blocks.md` guide covers the `Solana.blocks` table, which contains block data within Solana's blockchain. This guide is essential for analyzing block activity and transaction changes over time. It also includes examples of Solana Query, such as `Solana blocks over time` and `Transactions per day`, demonstrating how to use the `Solana.blocks` table effectively.

The `rewards.md` guide focuses on the `Solana.rewards` table, which contains data about rewards paid out on Solana. This guide is useful for developers working on the rewards feature of the app, as it provides information on the table's columns and an example query for calculating daily rewards paid out on Solana.

The `transactions.md` guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `Solana.transactions` table and the structs used to represent nested hierarchical data. This guide is crucial for developers working with transaction data within Solana's blockchain, as it includes detailed descriptions of each column and struct, as well as query examples that demonstrate how to use the data in the table.

Lastly, the `vote-transactions.md` guide covers the `Solana.vote_transactions` table, which contains the full set of vote transactions submitted by validators to vote on a block.
