The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\raw` folder contains a comprehensive app technical guide for working with raw data tables in the Dune Docs project. These guides provide detailed information on the structure, columns, and data types of the tables, as well as examples of how to use them in queries and analysis. The project feature this folder is focused on is the `data tables`.

For instance, the `blocks.md` guide covers the concept of blocks in blockchains and rollups, providing useful tables and column data that can be used to analyze block activity and transaction changes over time. This guide might be useful for analysts who want to track the growth of a specific blockchain or identify patterns in block activity.

Similarly, the `event-logs.md` guide focuses on the `Event Logs` tables, which store all logs data generated by smart contracts. This guide is particularly useful for developers who need to query contracts that are not yet decoded or are not able to be decoded since the code of the smart contract is not public.

The `traces.md` guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Traces feature, which contains information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions. This guide might be useful for analysts who want to understand the gas usage of specific transactions or identify the creation of new smart contracts.

Lastly, the `transactions.md` guide offers a detailed explanation of transactions in the Ethereum network, including tables and column data. This guide is crucial for developers working with transaction data, as it includes detailed descriptions of each column and examples of how to use the data in the table.

In addition to the main folder, there are two subfolders: `bitcoin` and `solana`. The `bitcoin` subfolder contains a comprehensive app technical guide for working with Bitcoin data, covering aspects such as blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs. The `solana` subfolder provides a thorough understanding of various Solana data tables and their usage in queries and analysis.

Overall, the guides in the `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\data tables\raw` folder provide a detailed understanding of various raw data tables and their usage in queries and analysis. These guides are essential for developers and analysts working with blockchain data and contribute significantly to the larger project feature of data tables.
