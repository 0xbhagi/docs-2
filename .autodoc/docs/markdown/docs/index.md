The second section of the guide focuses on analyzing Web3 data, specifically DEX volumes. It provides an interactive walkthrough of how to use the `dex.trades` table to find and preview data, write and run a basic query on the Dune SQL engine, and create and format a stacked bar chart visualization. The section also explains the concept of spellbook tables and provides links to column descriptions and documentation for lower-level tables. 

The third section of the guide provides resources and guides for learning SQL and blockchain basics. It includes links to beginner resources such as the Dune Official Getting Started Video Series, weekly Web3 SQL problems, and all Ethereum and SQL Basics. The section also provides links to pure SQL practice problems and encourages users to join the Dune community on Discord to learn together. 

The guide concludes by providing information on how to hire expert freelancers to help with advanced analysis. It includes a link to a questionnaire that users can fill out to reach out to the pool of expert freelancers. 

Overall, the Dune Quickstart guide is a comprehensive introduction to the Dune app and its features. It provides users with the necessary information to get started with Dune and perform basic and advanced analysis of Web3 data.
## Questions: 
 1. What kind of blockchain data can be analyzed using Dune?
- The app technical guide mentions that Dune can be used to analyze data from various chains, including EVMs like Ethereum, Polygon, Goerli, and Optimism, and non-EVM chains like Solana and Bitcoin.

2. What are spellbook tables and how are they different from raw and decoded tables?
- The app technical guide explains that spellbook tables are abstracted tables put together by star analysts in the community, while raw and decoded tables are lower level tables. Raw tables are defined in the guide, but for decoded tables, one would need to refer to the protocol's documentation.

3. How can one get help with Dune or hire an expert freelancer?
- The app technical guide suggests filling out a questionnaire on bounties.dune.com to reach out to a pool of expert freelancers. If that doesn't yield results, posting the bounty on relevant social channels and spreading it in networks may help. Additionally, one can join the Dune community on Discord and participate in the beginners and query-questions channels.
