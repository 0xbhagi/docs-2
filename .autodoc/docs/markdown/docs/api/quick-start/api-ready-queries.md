This app technical guide provides a list of queries that are ready for API use in the Dune Docs project. The guide is divided into four sections, each containing a query with its respective query ID, parameters, and output columns. The first query is for getting the ERC20 balances for a given address. The parameters include the address, block number, chain, and dust, while the output columns include the symbol, notional value, total value, and token price. The second query is for getting all the holders and their balances for a given ERC20 address. The parameters include the address, block number, and chain, while the output columns include the holder, holder_ens, notional value, total value, and token price. The third query is for getting the NFT balances for a given address. The parameters include the address, block number, and chain, while the output columns include the symbol, name, category, token_id, contract_address, acquired_how, and acquired_on_block_number. The fourth query is for getting all the holders and their balances for a given NFT address. The parameters include the address, block number, and chain, while the output columns include the holder, holder_ens, tokens_held, and token_ids. The guide also provides valid choices for each parameter and examples of how to use the queries. Overall, this guide serves as a reference for developers who want to use the Dune Docs API and provides them with the necessary information to use the queries effectively.
