The quick-start folder in the Dune Docs project focuses on providing users with a comprehensive guide to get started with the Dune API using different programming languages and tools. The guides in this folder are designed to help users quickly and efficiently set up their environment, authenticate with the API, and make requests to fetch data.

For example, the `api-js.md` guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on accessing the Dune API via JavaScript. It assumes users have some familiarity with Node.js, NPM, and NVM. The guide covers setting up the environment, installing the required packages, and provides example scripts for fetching data using simple and parameterized queries. This guide is useful for developers who prefer working with JavaScript and want to integrate the Dune API into their projects.

Similarly, the `api-py.md` guide covers accessing the Dune API using Python. It provides a detailed walkthrough on setting up the environment, installing necessary libraries, and creating functions to interact with the Dune API. This guide is beneficial for developers who prefer Python and want to fetch data from the Dune API for their projects.

The `api-ready-queries.md` guide offers a list of ready-to-use queries for the Dune API, including ERC20 and NFT balances and holders. This guide serves as a reference for developers who want to use the Dune API effectively and provides them with the necessary information to use the queries efficiently.

The `community-clients.md` guide showcases various Dune API clients built by the community, including Python, TypeScript, Go, and Ruby clients. It provides installation instructions and links to the respective GitHub pages for each client. This guide is helpful for developers who want to use community-built clients to interact with the Dune API.

Lastly, the `index.md` file serves as an overview of the quick-start guides, providing users with links to example queries, pipeline setups, and guides for using the API with Python, JavaScript, and community clients.

Overall, the quick-start folder in the Dune Docs project is an essential resource for users who want to get started with the Dune API quickly and efficiently. The guides provide clear and concise instructions for using the API with different programming languages and include links to example queries and pipeline setups, making it easier for developers to integrate the Dune API into their projects.
