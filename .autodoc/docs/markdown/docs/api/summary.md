The `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\api` folder contains the Dune API Technical Guide, which is a comprehensive documentation for developers who want to use the Dune API. The guide provides an overview of the API, instructions on how to get started, and links to important resources such as the API documentation, Discord channel, and community clients.

The guide is focused on the `api` folder of the Dune Docs project and is essential for developers looking to integrate with the Dune API and work effectively with its endpoints and functionalities. For example, the guide explains how to obtain an API key, which is required for authentication when making requests to the API. It also provides quick start guides for Python and Node.js, making it easier for developers to start using the API with their preferred programming language.

In addition to the main guide, the folder contains subfolders with more detailed information on various aspects of the API, such as the `api-reference` folder, which contains technical guides on authentication, executing queries, checking execution status, retrieving results, and handling errors. These guides are essential for developers who want to understand the capabilities and limitations of the Dune API.

For example, the `execute-query-id.md` guide in the `api-reference` folder provides a detailed explanation of how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. It includes examples of how to use cURL to execute the query, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to retrieve data from the Dune API.

The `FAQ` folder contains guides that answer frequently asked questions about the Dune API, covering topics such as billing and pricing, functionality, and other miscellaneous topics. These guides are essential for developers and analysts who want to understand and work with the Dune API effectively.

Lastly, the `quick-start` folder provides guides for getting started with the Dune API using different programming languages and tools. These guides help users quickly and efficiently set up their environment, authenticate with the API, and make requests to fetch data. For example, the `api-js.md` guide in the `quick-start` folder provides a step-by-step tutorial on accessing the Dune API via JavaScript, including setting up the environment, installing required packages, and providing example scripts for fetching data using simple and parameterized queries.

Overall, the `.autodoc\docs\json\docs\api` folder is an essential resource for developers and analysts working with the Dune API. It provides clear and concise information about various aspects of the API, helping users to understand its capabilities, limitations, and requirements.
