This app technical guide covers how to handle errors that may come up when working with the Dune API. The guide is divided into two main sections: "Invalid API Key" and "An Internal Error Occurred". Each section provides a response object and a list of checks to help users troubleshoot the error. 

The "Invalid API Key" section provides a response object of `{'error': 'invalid API Key'}` and two checks to help users resolve the error. The first check is to ensure that the API key is being passed to the endpoint in a header, as described in the Authentication section of the API reference. The second check is to ensure that the API key is correctly entered. 

The "An Internal Error Occurred" section provides a response object of `{'error': 'An internal error occurred'}` and two checks to help users resolve the error. The first check is to ensure that the `query_id` entered for GET endpoints is correct, while the second check is to ensure that the `execution_id` obtained from a GET endpoint is correctly passed on to a POST endpoint. 

The guide also includes a note that if users find the guide too technical or confusing, they can reach out to the Dune API team on the #dune-api Discord channel for support. 

Overall, this guide is a helpful resource for users of the Dune API who may encounter errors while working with the API. The guide provides clear response objects and actionable steps to help users troubleshoot and resolve errors.
