This app technical guide covers how to handle errors that may occur when working with the Dune API. The guide is divided into two main sections: Invalid API Key and An Internal Error Occurred. Each section provides a response object and a list of checks to help users troubleshoot the issue. 

The Invalid API Key section provides a response object of {'error': 'invalid API Key'} and two checks to help users resolve the issue. The first check is to ensure that the API key is passed to the endpoint in a header, as described in the Authentication section. The second check is to ensure that the API key is correctly entered. 

The An Internal Error Occurred section provides a response object of {'error': 'An internal error occurred'} and two checks to help users resolve the issue. The first check is to ensure that the query_id entered for GET endpoints is correct. The second check is to ensure that the execution_id obtained from the GET endpoint is correctly passed on to the POST endpoint for POST endpoints. 

The guide also includes a note that if users find the guide too technical or confusing, they can reach out to the Dune API team for support on the #dune-api Discord channel. 

Overall, this guide is a helpful resource for users of the Dune API who may encounter errors and need guidance on how to resolve them.
