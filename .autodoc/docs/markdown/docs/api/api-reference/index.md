# API Reference

This section of the Dune Docs project covers the API endpoints and common errors that may occur when using them. The purpose of this guide is to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of the API and how to use it effectively.

The guide is divided into several sections, each covering a specific aspect of the API. These sections include:

- **Authentication**: This section covers the authentication process for accessing the API. It provides information on how to obtain an API key and how to use it to authenticate requests.

- **Execute Query ID**: This section covers the endpoint for executing a query by ID. It provides information on the parameters required for this endpoint and the expected response.

- **Execution Status**: This section covers the endpoint for checking the status of a query execution. It provides information on the parameters required for this endpoint and the expected response.

- **Execution Results**: This section covers the endpoint for retrieving the results of a query execution. It provides information on the parameters required for this endpoint and the expected response.

- **Cancel Execution**: This section covers the endpoint for canceling a query execution. It provides information on the parameters required for this endpoint and the expected response.

- **Error Codes**: This section covers the error codes that may be returned by the API. It provides information on what each error code means and how to handle it.

Each section provides a detailed explanation of the endpoint or error code, including any required parameters and expected responses. The guide also includes links to the relevant files for each section.

For example, the **Authentication** section links to the `authentication.md` file in the `api-reference` folder, which provides more detailed information on the authentication process.

Overall, this API Reference guide is an essential resource for developers working with the Dune Docs API. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the API endpoints and common errors, helping developers to use the API effectively and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
