  "summary": "# Helpful Dashboards\n\nThis technical guide is focused on the app folder of the Dune Docs project. The guide provides a list of helpful dashboards for those looking to learn new Dune, Data Analytics, and Blockchain Analysis skills. The dashboards are divided into two categories: Tutorial Dashboards and Reference Dashboards.\n\nThe Tutorial Dashboards are great for learning new skills. The dashboards include Tips and Tricks for Dune V2 Queries and Visualizations, Data Visualization Cheat Sheet, Event and Function Signature Sleuthing, Getting Started, and Contract Quickstart. Each dashboard is created by a different user and provides a unique perspective on learning Dune.\n\nThe Reference Dashboards are helpful to refer to while building Queries. The dashboards include Meta Monitoring, Is my Contract Decoded Yet?, and Dune DB Guide. These dashboards are created by different users and provide a reference point for building queries.\n\nThe technical guide also provides a link to submit a GitHub Pull Request for any other dashboard that is helpful. If the dashboard is deemed helpful, it will be added to the list.\n\nFor example, if a user is looking to learn Dune V2 Queries and Visualizations, they can refer to the Tips and Tricks for Dune V2 Queries and Visualizations dashboard created by @springzhang. This dashboard provides tips and tricks for creating queries and visualizations in Dune V2.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a list of helpful dashboards for those looking to learn Dune, Data Analytics, and Blockchain Analysis skills. The dashboards are created by different users and provide a unique perspective on learning Dune.",

What kind of data analytics and blockchain analysis skills can be learned from the tutorial dashboards?\n   \n   The technical guide mentions that the tutorial dashboards are great for learning new Dune, Data Analytics, and Blockchain Analysis skills, but it does not provide specific examples or details about what those skills might be.\n\n3. How can a user submit a new dashboard to be added to the list?\n   \n   The technical guide mentions that users can submit a GitHub Pull Request to add a new dashboard to the list, but a blockchain SQL analyst might want more information on the submission process, such as what kind of criteria the Dune Analytics team uses to determine if a dashboard is helpful enough to be added to the list."
