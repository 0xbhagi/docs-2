  "summary": "# Utility Queries\n\nThis section of the Dune Docs project provides a list of queries that can be used to build other queries. The purpose of this section is to provide a starting point for users who want to create their own custom queries. The queries listed here are created by other users and are available for anyone to use.\n\nThe table provided in this section lists the name and link of each query, as well as the tag associated with it. The tag is used to categorize the queries and make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. The tags used in this section are \"decoding\", \"query starting point\", \"NFT\", and \"parameters\".\n\nFor example, the \"Is my Contract decoded yet\" queries by @0xBoxer are tagged as \"decoding\". These queries can be used to check if a contract has been decoded yet on different networks such as Polygon, xDAI, and BSC. The queries created by @ilemi are tagged as \"query starting point\" and can be used as a starting point for users who want to create their own custom queries. The query created by @hildobby is tagged as \"parameters\" and can be used to get the address from ENS.\n\nIf users have their own queries that they think should be included in this section, they can propose their changes by following the link provided in the description. \n\nOverall, this section of the Dune Docs project is a useful resource for users who want to create their own custom queries. By providing a list of queries that can be used as a starting point, users can save time and effort when creating their own queries.",
