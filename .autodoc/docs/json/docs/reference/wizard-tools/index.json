  "summary": "# Wizard Tools\n\nThis section of the app technical guide provides a list of non-Dune tools that the wizards use to make their work easier. The tools listed here are useful for learning how each ERC-xxx standard works, understanding the current crypto data ecosystem, auditing smart contracts, and digging into smart contracts to understand how they operate and their data structure. \n\nSome of the tools listed in this section include OpenZepplin's ERC-xxx Standards Docs, which are helpful for learning how each ERC-xxx standard works. The EVM Handbook is a curated list of EVM resources for aspiring blockchain data analysts. Solidity Visual Developer for VS Code is a helpful suite of tools for smart contract auditing inside of VS code. Deth.net is a set of Ethereum developer tools that help with blockchain data sleuthing. ZK Zhao's map of the Crypto Data Landscape is helpful for getting a sense of the current crypto data ecosystem. \n\nThe section also includes links to recommended reading lists for a bunch of guides on crypto data topics and projects to check out. DeepDAO provides stats on DAOs and their treasuries. DethCode lets you go into an Ethereum smart contract's code to read the comments or the actual logic can help to understand the smart contract's emitted data. Sidekik is useful for digging into smart contracts to understand how they operate and their data structure. Ethernaut is a wargame where you \"hack\" a set of smart contracts, useful for learning how smart contracts work. Advanced Ethereum Mini Courses are a good resource for understanding how theory applies to practice. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive list of tools that can be used to make the work of the wizards easier. The tools listed here are useful for anyone who wants to learn more about blockchain data analysis, smart contract auditing, and the current crypto data ecosystem.",
