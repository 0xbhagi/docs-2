  "summary": "# Blockchain Explorers\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the primary web-based explorers for the most popular blockchains. The purpose of this guide is to provide an overview of what blockchain explorers are and how they can be used by data analysts/scientists to explore a blockchain. \n\nThe guide explains that blockchain explorers provide an online interface for users to look up any particular blockchain of choice and retrieve data about transactions, addresses, blocks, and fees, amongst others. The guide then lists the primary web-based explorers for the most popular blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche C-Chain, Binance Smart Chain, and Gnosis Chain. \n\nThe guide also highlights that while blockchain explorers won't let users do half of the cool things Dune does, they are indispensable for figuring out how certain protocols work and what data needs to be included in queries. \n\nExample: If a data analyst/scientist wants to explore the Ethereum blockchain, they can use the Etherscan explorer listed in the guide to retrieve data about transactions, addresses, blocks, and fees. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a useful overview of blockchain explorers and their importance for data analysts/scientists.",
