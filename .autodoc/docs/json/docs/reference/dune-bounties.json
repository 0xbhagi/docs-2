  "summary": "The Dune Bounties technical guide is a comprehensive guide that explains how Dune Analytics empowers projects and wizards to collaborate through $$ incentives. The guide is divided into several sections that cover different aspects of the Dune Bounties project. \n\nThe guide starts by introducing Dune Analytics as a go-to solution for on-demand crypto analytics. It then highlights the problem that Wizards and Projects face in finding each other and how Dune Bounties solves this problem by creating a marketplace that handles task creation, application process, communication, reputation, and payments. \n\nThe guide then explains how Dune Bounties works by leveraging dework.xyz to set up a bounty board that manages Dune internal bounty programs. The guide also provides detailed instructions on how organizations can connect with Dune Wizards and how Wizards can find tasks. \n\nThe guide also provides some notes about working on Dune, which can be roughly separated into two parts: the App Layer and the Data Layer. The App Layer contains Queries, Visualizations, and Dashboards, while the Data Layer allows Wizards to produce scalable and persistent work by standardizing and normalizing data. \n\nThe guide concludes with a Dune Bounties FAQ section that answers common questions about the project, such as how much to pay Wizards, how Wizards get paid, and how to choose the right applicant. \n\nOverall, the Dune Bounties technical guide is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning about Dune Analytics and how it empowers projects and Wizards to collaborate through $$ incentives. The guide provides detailed instructions on how to use Dune Bounties, making it easy for organizations and Wizards to get started.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of Dune Bounties and how does it relate to blockchain data analysis?\n    \n    Dune Bounties is a marketplace that connects projects in need of web3 analytics with Dune Wizards who want jobs. It allows for task creation, application process, communication, reputation, and payments, and is web3 native. This platform can be used by blockchain SQL analysts to find jobs and get paid for their work.\n\n2. How does Dune Bounties handle payments and what wallets does it integrate with?\n    \n    Dune Bounties uses Dework's native payment feature, which allows Wizards to connect their wallet in their Dework profile and get paid as soon as the bounty is paid out by the Project that created the task. Dework integrates with Metamask, Gnosis Safe, Utopia Labs, and Phantom wallet for Solana-based payments.\n\n3. How can Dune Bounties help with data normalization and standardization for blockchain data analysis?\n    \n    Dune Bounties can help with data normalization and standardization by allowing projects to define tasks with the \"Dune Analytics\" Skill, which will appear in the Dune hub. By transforming raw data and adding it to the `opensea.trades` table inside of Spellbook, Dune Wizards can easily work with the data as it's cleaned and standardized. This makes it more likely that Wizards will incorporate the data into their work as the `nft.trades` table contains data from all marketplaces across all chains."
