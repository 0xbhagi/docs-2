  "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Reference\n\nThe Reference section of the Dune Docs project is designed to provide answers to common questions about the app. This section is particularly useful for users who are new to the app and need help getting started. \n\nThe header of the guide provides a brief overview of what users can expect to find in the Reference section. It explains that this section is the place to get answers to \"who, what, where\" questions. For example, users can find information about what data exists in Dune Tables, what tools are helpful for building dashboards, and where to find Dune events and support. \n\nThe guide also mentions that the Reference section includes a few supplemental resources, such as Wizard Tools. This is an example of how the guide provides specific examples of what users can expect to find in this section of the app. \n\nThe note at the beginning of the guide is worth mentioning as well.
