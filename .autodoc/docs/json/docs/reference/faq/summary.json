      "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Does Dune Have a Token?\n\nThis guide covers the topic of whether or not the Dune app has a token. The purpose of this guide is to provide a clear answer to this question for users who may be wondering about the app's authentication system.\n\nThe header \"Does Dune have a Token?\" is a high-level question that sets the tone for the rest of the guide. The answer is provided in the next section, which states that \"Dune does not have a token.\" This information is important for users who may be looking for a token-based authentication system and need to know that Dune does not offer this feature.\n\nOverall, this guide is relevant to the app folder of the Dune Docs project, as it pertains to the app's authentication system. It is a short and straightforward guide that provides a clear answer to a common question. \n\nExample: \nIf a user is trying to integrate Dune with another app that requires a token-based authentication system, they can refer to this guide to confirm that Dune does not offer this feature. This can save the user time and effort in trying to implement a feature that is not available in the app.",

      "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Does Dune have an API?\n\nThis guide covers the topic of whether Dune has an API and how to access it. The purpose of this guide is to inform users that Dune does indeed have an API and to provide instructions on how to obtain access to it. \n\nThe first header confirms that Dune has an API. The second header provides instructions on how to obtain access to the API. Users must sign up for a paid plan and add on API access to gain access to the API. The guide provides a link to pricing details for users to determine which plan is best for them. \n\nThe third header provides a link to learn more about how to use the API. This section is likely to contain more detailed information on how to use the API, including authentication, endpoints, and parameters. \n\nThe final header provides options for users who do not have API access. Paid plan users can export results as CSV, while anyone can embed Dune charts on their page for free by clicking \"Embed\" on any query visualization. \n\nOverall, this guide is a brief overview of Dune's API and how to access it. It is likely that users who are interested in using the API will need to refer to additional documentation to fully understand how to use it. \n\nExample: \n\nIf a user is interested in using Dune's API, they can refer to this guide to learn that Dune does indeed have an API and how to obtain access to it. They can then follow the link to learn more about how to use the API and refer to additional documentation as needed. If a user does not have API access, they can still export results as CSV or embed Dune charts on their page for free.",
      "questions": "1. What kind of data can be accessed through Dune's API?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the specific data that can be accessed through Dune's API.\n\n2. Is there a limit to the number of API requests that can be made?\n- The app technical guide does not mention any limits on the number of API requests that can be made.\n\n3. Are there any authentication or security measures in place for accessing the API?\n- The app technical guide mentions that API access is only available to paid plan users, but does not provide information on any authentication or security measures in place for accessing the API."

      "summary": "# App Technical Guide: How often do results get refreshed?\n\nThis technical guide provides information on how often results get refreshed in the Dune app. The guide starts by directing users to the Meta Monitoring dashboard to see the current time it takes for new data to be added to Dune. \n\nThe guide then explains how results get refreshed in the app. When a visualization is viewed on a query page or dashboard, the Dune backend inspects the age of the most recent result. If the result is stale (currently defined as >3 hours old), Dune automatically queues an execution for this query and runs it in the background. This ensures that dashboards are always kept up to date when they are being viewed, and the query creator does not need to set a refresh schedule. \n\nThe guide also notes that the query execution queue is separate from each individual user's queue when they create and run queries in the query editor. \n\nOverall, this guide provides important information on how the Dune app keeps results up to date and ensures that dashboards are always displaying the most recent data. It also highlights the Meta Monitoring dashboard as a resource for users to check the current time it takes for new data to be added to Dune. \n\nExample: If a user is viewing a dashboard and notices that the data is not up to date, they can refer to this guide to understand how results get refreshed in the app. They can also check the Meta Monitoring dashboard to see if there are any delays in adding new data to Dune.",
      "questions": "1. What is the definition of \"stale\" data in this app and how is it determined?\n   \n   The definition of \"stale\" data in this app is data that is more than 3 hours old. This is determined by the Dune backend when inspecting the age of the most recent result.\n\n2. Is there a way for users to manually refresh the data or set a custom refresh schedule?\n   \n   It is not mentioned in the app technical guide whether users can manually refresh the data or set a custom refresh schedule. However, it is stated that dashboards will always be kept up to date when they are being viewed and the query creator does not need to set a refresh schedule.\n\n3. How does the query execution queue work and is there a limit to the number of queries that can be queued at once?\n   \n   The app technical guide mentions that the query execution queue is separate from each individual user's queue when they create and run queries in the query editor. However, it does not provide information on how the query execution queue works or if there is a limit to the number of queries that can be queued at once."

      "summary": "# Overview\n\nThis app technical guide provides an explanation of how Dune, a project focused on blockchain data analysis, obtains its data. The guide explains that Dune works with node providers across the industry to ingest raw historical data from various blockchains. The guide also clarifies that state data is not included in the data obtained by Dune. \n\n# How Dune Gets Its Data\n\nThe guide explains that Dune collaborates with node providers to obtain data from various blockchains. This data is then ingested into Dune's database. The guide emphasizes that Dune does not discriminate against any smart contract and that users can submit any contract via the decoding page. The only prerequisite for this is an ABI so that Dune can decode the contract. \n\n# Example\n\nFor instance, if a user wants to work with a smart contract on Dune, they can submit the contract via the decoding page. Dune will then decode the contract using the ABI and ingest the data into its database. This allows users to work with the contract in a matter of hours. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a clear explanation of how Dune obtains its data and highlights the importance of ABIs in the process. It is a useful resource for anyone looking to understand the data acquisition process in Dune.",
      "questions": "1. What blockchains does Dune Docs currently support for data ingestion?\n- The app technical guide does not provide specific information on which blockchains Dune Docs supports for data ingestion.\n\n2. Does Dune Docs provide access to state data?\n- The app technical guide states that Dune Docs does not include state data in its data ingestion process.\n\n3. How does Dune Docs decode smart contracts submitted through its decoding page?\n- The app technical guide mentions that the only prerequisite for submitting a smart contract through the decoding page is an ABI, which is used to decode the contract."
