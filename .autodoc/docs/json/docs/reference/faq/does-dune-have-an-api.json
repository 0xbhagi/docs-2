  "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Does Dune have an API?\n\nThis guide covers the topic of whether Dune has an API and how to access it. The purpose of this guide is to inform users that Dune does indeed have an API and to provide instructions on how to obtain access to it. \n\nThe first header confirms that Dune has an API. The second header provides instructions on how to obtain access to the API. Users must sign up for a paid plan and add on API access to gain access to the API. The guide provides a link to pricing details for users to determine which plan is best for them. \n\nThe third header provides a link to learn more about how to use the API. This section is likely to contain more detailed information on how to use the API, including authentication, endpoints, and parameters. \n\nThe final header provides options for users who do not have API access. Paid plan users can export results as CSV, while anyone can embed Dune charts on their page for free by clicking \"Embed\" on any query visualization. \n\nOverall, this guide is a brief overview of Dune's API and how to access it. It is likely that users who are interested in using the API will need to refer to additional documentation to fully understand how to use it. \n\nExample: \n\nIf a user is interested in using Dune's API, they can refer to this guide to learn that Dune does indeed have an API and how to obtain access to it. They can then follow the link to learn more about how to use the API and refer to additional documentation as needed.
