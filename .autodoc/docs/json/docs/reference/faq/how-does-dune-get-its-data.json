  "summary": "# Overview\n\nThis app technical guide provides an explanation of how Dune, a project focused on blockchain data analysis, obtains its data. The guide explains that Dune works with node providers across the industry to ingest raw historical data from various blockchains. The guide also clarifies that state data is not included in the data obtained by Dune. \n\n# How Dune Gets Its Data\n\nThe guide explains that Dune collaborates with node providers to obtain data from various blockchains. This data is then ingested into Dune's database. The guide emphasizes that Dune does not discriminate against any smart contract and that users can submit any contract via the decoding page. The only prerequisite for this is an ABI so that Dune can decode the contract. \n\n# Example\n\nFor instance, if a user wants to work with a smart contract on Dune, they can submit the contract via the decoding page. Dune will then decode the contract using the ABI and ingest the data into its database. This allows users to work with the contract in a matter of hours. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a clear explanation of how Dune obtains its data and highlights the importance of ABIs in the process. It is a useful resource for anyone looking to understand the data acquisition process in Dune.",
  "questions": "1. What blockchains does Dune Docs currently support for data ingestion?\n- The app technical guide does not provide specific information on which blockchains Dune Docs supports for data ingestion.\n\n2. Does Dune Docs provide access to state data?\n- The app technical guide states that Dune Docs does not include state data in its data ingestion process.\n\n3. How does Dune Docs decode smart contracts submitted through its decoding page?\n- The app technical guide mentions that the only prerequisite for submitting a smart contract through the decoding page is an ABI, which is used to decode the contract."
