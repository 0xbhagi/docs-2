  "summary": "# The Data Explorer\n\nThis technical guide covers the Data Explorer feature of the Dune app. The Data Explorer allows users to search for blockchain and other data to use in their Queries. The guide explains how to use the Data Explorer to find the data you need. \n\nThe guide starts by explaining how to select the database you want to search in and how to enter keywords, protocol names, contract names, or event names into the search bar to bring up a list of Tables containing blockchain data that can be used in Queries. \n\nThe guide then goes on to explain how to perform advanced searches in Dune V2 and V1. The V2 section explains how to search for data in the Dune V2 database, which contains all data accessible in one data lake. The V1 section explains how to search for data in the Dune V1 Engine, which has separate databases for each blockchain. \n\nThe guide provides examples of how to search for data using keywords, how to find specific schemas, events, calls, or contracts, and how to find specific contract data. It also explains how to add references to the Query Window. \n\nThe guide includes screenshots and GIFs to illustrate how to use the Data Explorer and how to perform advanced searches. It also provides warnings and notes to alert users to the fact that the V2 Data Explorer is still in beta and that the V2 explorer is not case sensitive. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Data Explorer feature of the Dune app and explains how to use it to find the data you need for your Queries.",
