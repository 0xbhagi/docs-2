  "summary": "The app technical guide provides a detailed explanation of how to use the Data Explorer feature of the Dune Docs project. The Data Explorer is a tool that allows users to search for blockchain and other data to use in their queries. The guide explains how to use the Data Explorer to find the data you need by selecting the database you want to search in and entering keywords, protocol names, contract names, or event names into the search bar. \n\nThe guide also provides information on advanced searching in Dune V2 and V1. It explains that Dune V2 has a different data structure than V1, and that with V2, users can incorporate data from multiple chains in one SQL query. The guide provides examples of how to search for data within specific datasets and how to limit searches to specific categories for better speed. \n\nThe guide also explains the use of icons and labels in the Data Explorer, which provide information on which blockchain a Spell, Protocol contract set, or individual contract belongs to, whether a piece of data/dataset is a Spell, Decoded Contract, or Community Dataset, and what type a piece of data is. The guide provides a link to descriptions of what all the icons and labels mean. \n\nOverall, the guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the Data Explorer feature of the Dune Docs project, including advanced searching techniques and the use of icons and labels. It provides clear examples and instructions for users to follow, making it easy to understand and use the Data Explorer effectively.",
  "questions": "1. What databases can be searched using the Data Explorer?\n   \n   The Data Explorer allows searching for blockchain and other data, but a blockchain SQL analyst might want to know specifically which databases are available for searching. The app technical guide mentions that the user can select which database to search from a dropdown list, but it does not provide information on the specific databases available.\n\n2. How does the search function work in Dune V2 compared to V1?\n   \n   The app technical guide provides detailed information on how the search function works in Dune V2 and V1, including how to search for specific schemas, events, calls, and contracts. A blockchain SQL analyst might want to know the differences between the search functions in V2 and V1 to determine which version to use for their queries.\n\n3. What are the different categories of datasets available in Dune V2?\n   \n   The app technical guide mentions that there are four different categories of datasets available in Dune V2, but it does not provide information on what those categories are. A blockchain SQL analyst might want to know the categories to determine which dataset to search for their queries."
