  "summary": "# Data Explorer Labels\n\nThis technical guide covers the labels used in the Data Explorer of the Dune Docs project. The guide provides a detailed explanation of the different labels used in the project, including blockchain icons, dataset icons, dataset labels, and data type labels.\n\nThe blockchain icons section explains the different blockchain icons that can be found in some data sets. Each icon represents a specific blockchain, including Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche C-Chain, Ethereum Goerli Testnet, and Fantom. The icons can represent raw data, decoded projects, or spells.\n\nThe dataset icons section explains the different icons that represent data tables, decoded projects, spells, and community data sets. The data table icon can represent raw data, spells, or smart contract events or functions. The decoded project icon represents a protocol or protocol version, such as \"opensea\" or \"aave_v2\". The spell icon represents a spell set, such as cow_protocol containing \"batches\" and \"solvers\" spells. The community data icon represents a community data set.\n\nThe dataset labels section explains the different labels that can be used to identify a specific data set. The labels include project, sector, event, and function. The project label represents a spell set for a specific project, such as \"aave\". The sector label represents a spell set for a sector, such as \"dex\". The event label represents a smart contract event dataset, and the function label represents a smart contract function dataset.\n\nThe data type labels section explains the different labels used to represent data types. The labels include string, long, integer, double, boolean, date, timestamp, decimal, and array. The guide provides a link to the full Spark SQL data types documentation and the official PostgreSQL data types for V1 data.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of the different labels used in the Data Explorer of the Dune Docs project. It helps users understand the meaning of each label and how to identify specific data sets. The guide also provides links to additional resources for more information on data types.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Data Explorer in relation to blockchain data?\n- The Data Explorer is used to explore and analyze blockchain data from various blockchains, including Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche C-Chain, Ethereum Goerli Testnet, and Fantom.\n\n2. What types of data sets are available in the Data Explorer?\n- The Data Explorer includes data sets such as Raw Data, Decoded Project, Spell, smart contract Event, smart contract Function, and Community Data Set.\n\n3. What are the available data types in the Data Explorer?\n- The available data types in the Data Explorer include string, long, integer, double, boolean, date, timestamp, decimal, and array. More information on these data types can be found in the Spark SQL data types documentation and the PostgreSQL data types documentation."
