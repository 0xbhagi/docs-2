  "summary": "This app technical guide covers the Query Window feature of the Dune app. The Query Window is where users can input SQL code and run it. The guide provides an overview of the Query Window and its features, including Autocomplete, Run Selection, and Shortcuts.\n\nThe Autocomplete feature can be enabled or disabled using the gear wheel in the top right corner of the Query editor. It brings up PostgreSQL keywords, tables, and aliases that have already been included in the Query. The guide provides an example of how to turn on Autocomplete and how it works in the Query editor.\n\nThe Run Selection feature allows users to save time while testing and debugging Queries by running just a part of the Query. Users can highlight a part of the Query, and the Run button will turn into a Run Selection button. The guide provides an example of how to use the Run Selection feature and what happens when a syntactically complete and correct piece of SQL is not highlighted.\n\nThe guide also provides a list of Shortcuts to make crafting Queries faster. These shortcuts include executing the Query, commenting out selected code, bringing up a list of keywords, undoing and redoing changes, and searching for and replacing keywords. The guide notes that these shortcuts work on US/UK keyboards and may vary based on the language setting on the user's machine.\n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Query Window feature and its various functions. It is a useful resource for users who are new to the Dune app or who want to learn more about its features.",
