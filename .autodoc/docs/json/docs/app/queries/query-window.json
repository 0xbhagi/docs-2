  "summary": "# The Query Window\n\nThis technical guide covers the Query window in the Dune Docs project. The Query window is where users can input SQL code and run it. The guide provides information on how to use the Query window effectively.\n\n## Autocomplete\n\nThe guide explains how to enable or disable the autocomplete function of the Query editor using the gear wheel in the top right corner. The autocomplete feature brings up PostgreSQL keywords, tables, and aliases that have already been included in the Query. The guide provides an example of how to turn on autocomplete and how it works in the Query editor.\n\n## Run Selection\n\nThe guide explains how to save time while testing and debugging Queries by running just a part of the Query. Users can highlight a part of the Query, and the <span class=\"fk-btn-1\">Run</span> button will turn into a <span class=\"fk-btn-1\">Run selection</span> button. The guide provides an example of how to run a selection and what happens when a user highlights an incorrect piece of SQL.\n\n## Shortcuts\n\nThe guide provides a list of shortcuts that users can use to make crafting Queries faster. The shortcuts include executing the Query, commenting out selected code, bringing up a list of keywords, undoing and redoing changes, and searching for and replacing keywords. The guide notes that these shortcuts work on US/UK keyboards and may vary based on the language setting on the user's machine.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Query window in the Dune Docs project. It explains how to use the Query window effectively and provides examples of how to use its features.",
