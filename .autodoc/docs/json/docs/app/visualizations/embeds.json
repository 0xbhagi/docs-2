  "summary": "# Embeds\n\nThis guide covers the use of Embeds in the Dune app. Embeds allow users to share live Dune charts across different web platforms. The guide explains how to generate embed links and how to use them on different platforms such as Twitter, Discord, web pages, and Mirror.xyz. \n\nThe guide starts by highlighting the benefits of using Embeds over screenshots. It then explains how to generate embed links by clicking on any query title and selecting the embed function in the top right corner. The guide also notes that the embed button works as a stand-alone link and as a way to embed live graphs into websites/apps. If a Query has no Visualizations, the link will be to the Query Results table. If you have multiple Visualizations, the link will be for whichever Visualization you've selected when you clicked the Embed button. \n\nThe guide then provides examples of how to use Embeds on different platforms. For instance, on Twitter, users can paste their embed link, and Twitter will automatically render and update Dune Visualizations. On Discord, users can drop the embed link in the chat, and the corresponding Visualization will be displayed. The guide also provides a code snippet example of how to use Dune's embed links to add live Visualizations to any web page using an `iframe`. \n\nThe guide also explains how to embed Dune Visualizations into articles on Mirror.xyz. Users can generate an embed link and postfix it with `?display=iframe`. The guide notes that Embeds do not work in a couple of popular web platforms, including Substack, Medium, and GitBook. \n\nFinally, the guide explains how to use parameterized Embeds. The embed links work with parameterized Queries, but users need to manually prefix the parameter link with the parameters. The guide provides an example of how to do this. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use Embeds in the Dune app. It explains how to generate embed links and how to use them on different platforms. The guide also provides examples and code snippets to help users get started with Embeds.",
