      "summary": "# Embeds\n\nThis guide covers the use of Embeds in the Dune app. Embeds allow users to share live Dune charts across different web platforms. The guide explains how to generate embed links and how to use them on different platforms such as Twitter, Discord, web pages, and Mirror.xyz. \n\nThe guide starts by highlighting the benefits of using Embeds over screenshots. It then explains how to generate embed links by clicking on any query title and selecting the embed function in the top right corner. The guide also notes that the embed button works as a stand-alone link and as a way to embed live graphs into websites/apps. If a Query has no Visualizations, the link will be to the Query Results table. If you have multiple Visualizations, the link will be for whichever Visualization you've selected when you clicked the Embed button. \n\nThe guide then provides examples of how to use Embeds on different platforms. For instance, on Twitter, users can paste their embed link, and Twitter will automatically render and update Dune Visualizations. On Discord, users can drop the embed link in the chat, and the corresponding Visualization will be displayed. The guide also provides a code snippet example of how to use Dune's embed links to add live Visualizations to any web page using an `iframe`. \n\nThe guide also explains how to embed Dune Visualizations into articles on Mirror.xyz. Users can generate an embed link and postfix it with `?display=iframe`. The guide notes that Embeds do not work in a couple of popular web platforms, including Substack, Medium, and GitBook. \n\nFinally, the guide explains how to use parameterized Embeds. The embed links work with parameterized Queries, but users need to manually prefix the parameter link with the parameters. The guide provides an example of how to do this. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use Embeds in the Dune app. It explains how to generate embed links and how to use them on different platforms. The guide also provides examples and code snippets to help users get started with Embeds.",

      "summary": "# Visualizations\n\nThe purpose of this section of the app technical guide is to provide information on how to create visualizations using Dune. The guide is divided into two main sections: Charts & Graphs and Other Visualizations.\n\n## Charts & Graphs\n\nThis section explains and provides examples on how to create popular visualizations using Dune. The guide covers various types of charts and graphs such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots. It also explains how to customize these visualizations by changing colors, labels, and other properties.\n\nExample: If a user wants to create a line chart to display the trend of sales over time, they can refer to this section of the guide to learn how to create the chart and customize it to their needs.\n\n## Other Visualizations\n\nThis section covers a few more unique visualizations that can be created using Dune. It includes examples of heat maps, word clouds, and network graphs. The guide explains how to create these visualizations and provides tips on how to effectively use them.\n\nExample: If a user wants to create a word cloud to display the most commonly used words in a document, they can refer to this section of the guide to learn how to create the visualization and adjust the settings to display the desired information.\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide is a helpful resource for users who want to create visualizations using Dune. It provides clear explanations and examples on how to create various types of visualizations and customize them to meet specific needs.",
      "questions": "1. What type of data does this app visualize?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the type of data that is visualized.\n\n2.

      "summary": "# Other Visualizations\n\nThis guide covers non-graph visualizations that can be created using Dune. The guide is divided into two sections: Tables and Counters.\n\n## Tables\n\nTables are the default visualization that appears when a query is run. The guide explains how to create additional tables and customize them. The following options can be configured for each column in a table:\n\n- Title: The title that appears at the top of the column. If left blank, the column title will be the same as its Dune database name.\n- Align: The text alignment for the column data and title.\n- Format: The numerical format of the data.\n- Hide Column: Hides the column from the table.\n\nNumerical columns have additional options:\n\n- Type: Displays the column's numerical data or shows it with a progress bar visual.\n- Colored Values: Colors positive values green and negative values red.\n\n## Counters\n\nCounters are a way to display \"on a glance\" stats. The guide explains how to configure counters and adjust how numerical data is displayed. The following options can be configured for counters:\n\n- Title: The title that appears at the top of the counter. If left blank, the query name will be the only thing displayed.\n- Column: The column the counter should show.\n- Row: The row of the underlying data table to be displayed.\n- Prefix: A prefix for the counter value.\n- Suffix: A suffix for the counter value.\n- Label: A label for the counter value.\n- Decimals: The number of decimal places to be displayed.\n\nThe guide provides examples and screenshots to illustrate how to configure tables and counters.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of Dune Docs and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of Dune Docs or its relation to blockchain technology, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to seek additional documentation or context.\n2. Can Dune Docs visualize data from blockchain databases?\n- The app technical guide does not specify which types of databases Dune Docs can visualize, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to investigate further to determine if it is compatible with blockchain databases.\n3. Are there any limitations to the numerical data formatting options for Counters?\n- The app technical guide states that the number of decimal places is currently limited to 3, but it does not provide information on any other limitations or restrictions, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to test the app or consult with the development team to determine any other limitations."
