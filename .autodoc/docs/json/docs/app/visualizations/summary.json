      "summary": "# Charts & Graphs\n\nThis technical guide covers how to create different types of graphs and charts using Dune. The guide explains how to create bar charts, area charts, scatter charts, line charts, pie charts, and mixed graphs. It also explains how to configure each visualization option, including chart options, result data, x-axis options, y-axis options, series options, and pie options.\n\nThe guide provides examples of each type of graph and explains how to edit each graph type. For instance, the guide explains how to enable or disable the legend for the chart, stack the chart values on top of each other based on the x-axis values, normalize the chart to display percentage values of the chosen data table, and display the individual datapoints inside of the graph.\n\nThe guide also explains how to pick the data points that are to be displayed, how to influence how your x-axis data gets displayed, and how to influence how your y-axis data gets displayed. Additionally, the guide explains how to finalize your graph by renaming the \"series,\" changing the chart type, changing the colors, and changing the order of the series.\n\nFinally, the guide explains how to format tick and label formats for numeric values and axis labels in your graphs. It provides a table that shows how to format tick and label formats for different starting values. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to create different types of graphs and charts using Dune. It is a useful resource for anyone who wants to create visualizations of their data.",

      "summary": "# Embeds\n\nThis technical guide explains how to use the Embeds feature in the Dune Docs project. Embeds allow users to share live Dune charts across different web platforms. The guide starts by explaining how to generate an embed link by clicking on any query title and selecting the embed function in the top right corner. The guide also clarifies that the embed button works as a standalone link and as a way to embed live graphs into websites/apps. If a query has no visualizations, the link will be to the query results table. If there are multiple visualizations, the link will be for whichever visualization the user has selected when they clicked the Embed button.\n\nThe guide then goes on to explain how to use Embeds on different platforms such as Twitter, Discord, web pages, and Mirror.xyz. For Twitter, users can simply paste their embed link, and Twitter will render and update Dune visualizations automatically. For Discord, users can drop the embed link in the chat, and the corresponding visualization will be displayed. The guide also explains how to add live visualizations to any web page using an `iframe` and provides a code snippet example. For Mirror.xyz, users can easily embed Dune visualizations into articles by generating an embed link and postfixing it with `?display=iframe`.\n\nThe guide also highlights some known issues with Embeds, stating that they do not work in a couple of popular web platforms such as Substack, Medium, and GitBook. Finally, the guide explains how to use parameterized embeds, which work with parameterized queries. However, it is a bit tricky to get them to work, and users need to manually prefix the parameter link with the parameters. The guide provides an example of how to do this.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of how to use the Embeds feature in the Dune Docs project. It covers different platforms and provides examples and code snippets to help users understand how to use Embeds effectively.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of Dune Docs and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n    \n    Answer: The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of Dune Docs or its relation to blockchain technology, so a blockchain SQL analyst might have this question.\n\n2. Can Dune embeds be used with other data visualization tools besides Dune charts?\n    \n    Answer: The app technical guide does not provide information on whether Dune embeds can be used with other data visualization tools, so a blockchain SQL analyst might have this question.\n\n3. Are there any security concerns with using Dune embeds on web pages or other platforms?\n    \n    Answer: The app technical guide does not provide information on any security concerns with using Dune embeds, so a blockchain SQL analyst might have this question."

The guide is divided into two sections: Tables and Counters. \n\nThe Tables section explains how to create tables to display data. The default visualization for query results is a table, and users can create additional tables using the \"New visualization\" button and drop-down menu. The guide provides instructions on how to configure tables, including options for the table title and each column. Users can adjust the text alignment, numerical format, and visibility of each column. For numerical columns, users can choose between a normal display or a progress bar display, and can color positive and negative values. \n\nThe Counters section explains how to create counters, which are useful for displaying \"on a glance\" stats. Users can define which column and row of the underlying data table they want to display, and can adjust the formatting of the numerical data. Users can add a prefix or suffix to the counter value, and can choose how many decimal places to display. Additionally, users can add a label beneath the counter value. \n\nThe guide provides several examples of each type of visualization, including screenshots of the configuration options.
