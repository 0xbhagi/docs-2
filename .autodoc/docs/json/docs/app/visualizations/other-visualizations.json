  "summary": "# Other Visualizations\n\nThis guide covers non-graph visualizations that can be created using Dune. The guide is divided into two sections: Tables and Counters.\n\n## Tables\n\nTables are the default visualization that appears when a query is run. The guide explains how to create additional tables and customize them. The following options can be configured for each column in a table:\n\n- Title: The title that appears at the top of the column. If left blank, the column title will be the same as its Dune database name.\n- Align: The text alignment for the column data and title.\n- Format: The numerical format of the data.\n- Hide Column: Hides the column from the table.\n\nNumerical columns have additional options:\n\n- Type: Displays the column's numerical data or shows it with a progress bar visual.\n- Colored Values: Colors positive values green and negative values red.\n\n## Counters\n\nCounters are a way to display \"on a glance\" stats. The guide explains how to configure counters and adjust how numerical data is displayed. The following options can be configured for counters:\n\n- Title: The title that appears at the top of the counter. If left blank, the query name will be the only thing displayed.\n- Column: The column the counter should show.\n- Row: The row of the underlying data table to be displayed.\n- Prefix: A prefix for the counter value.\n- Suffix: A suffix for the counter value.\n- Label: A label for the counter value.\n- Decimals: The number of decimal places to be displayed.\n\nThe guide provides examples and screenshots to illustrate how to configure tables and counters.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of Dune Docs and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of Dune Docs or its relation to blockchain technology, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to seek additional documentation or context.\n2. Can Dune Docs visualize data from blockchain databases?\n- The app technical guide does not specify which types of databases Dune Docs can visualize, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to investigate further to determine if it is compatible with blockchain databases.\n3. Are there any limitations to the numerical data formatting options for Counters?\n- The app technical guide states that the number of decimal places is currently limited to 3, but it does not provide information on any other limitations or restrictions, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to test the app or consult with the development team to determine any other limitations."
