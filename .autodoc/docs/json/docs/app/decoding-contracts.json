  "summary": "The app technical guide titled \"Decoding Contracts\" provides a comprehensive guide on how to submit contracts for decoding on the Dune platform. The guide is divided into several sections, each with a specific focus. The first section provides an overview of Decoded Contracts and how they are brought into the platform through Wizard submissions. The section explains how contracts are decoded into human-readable tables for each event and function defined in the smart contract's ABI. The section also provides a link to learn more about how Decoding works and what Decoded tables are available.\n\nThe second section of the guide focuses on submitting a new contract for decoding. The section provides three ways to submit contracts for decoding, including the New contract form, the My Creations > Contracts Tab, and within the dataset explorer in the Query editor's sidebar. The section also provides a contract submission form that consists of two steps. The first step requests the contract's address and blockchain to enable the review of potential duplicate contracts and pending submissions. The second step requests other information about the contract that is needed to decode it.\n\nThe third section of the guide provides advanced options for detecting and indexing multiple contract addresses under the same submission. The section explains two strategies for detecting other contracts for decoding, including bytecode match and factory instances. The section also provides a warning to only use these options if you know what you're doing and are extremely familiar with the project's architecture and deployment hierarchy.\n\nThe fourth section of the guide focuses on tracking submissions. The section explains how to view submissions and their processing status at any time by navigating to My Creations > Contracts.\n\nThe fifth section of the guide provides answers to frequently asked questions. The section provides answers to questions such as how to submit contract information manually, how to submit a Proxy contract, how to re-submit a contract, and how to submit Diamond Proxy contracts. The section also provides a warning that Dune rejects duplicative, incorrect, or low-quality submissions.\n\nOverall, the guide provides a detailed explanation of how to submit contracts for decoding on the Dune platform. The guide is well-structured and easy to follow, with examples and images provided where appropriate.",
  "questions": "1. What is the process for submitting a new contract for decoding?\n- Contracts can be submitted for decoding through the new contract form, the My Creations > Contracts Tab, or within the dataset explorer in the Query editor's sidebar. The contract submission form consists of two steps: blockchain and address, and contract details.\n\n2. How does Dune index multiple contract addresses under the same submission?\n- Dune can automatically detect and index multiple contract addresses under the same submission by using bytecode match or factory instances. If users want Dune to index more than one contract, they can toggle on Advanced options and select \"Yes\" to the first question, \"Are there several instances of this contract?\"\n\n3. How do I re-submit a contract?\n- If users attempt to submit a contract that already exists, Dune will first present a warning note and ask users to confirm if they want to proceed. Then, at the bottom of the Details page, Dune will ask users to explain why they're resubmitting the contract so Dune can assess whether it's worth overriding the contract's data. If Dune believes the risk of accepting a re-submission is higher than the added value, Dune will reject the resubmission."
