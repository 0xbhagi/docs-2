  "summary": "# Use Cases\n\nThe app technical guide for Dune Docs covers the use cases of the Dune platform, which is a blockchain data analytics platform. The guide explains that Dune serves three different groups: Dune Spectators, Dune Wizards, and Dune Patrons. Dune Spectators can view on-chain data via dashboards on Dune.com. Dune Wizards take the raw data and use it to tell stories via dashboards, visualizations, and queries. Dune Patrons leverage Dune's powers to solve problems and share insights within their organizations.\n\nThe guide goes on to explain that nearly the entire world of blockchain data analytics can be explored with Dune, and there aren't many limitations to what you can query and visualize with Dune. However, to help users get a clearer picture of the type of problems they can explore and solve with Dune, the guide establishes a few broad use cases: Project Dashboards, Sector Dashboards, and Ecosystem Dashboards.\n\nThe guide also provides a link to Dune's Twitter account, where users can follow and see how people are currently using Dune. \n\nOverall, this guide provides an overview of the Dune platform and its capabilities. It explains the different groups that can benefit from using Dune and the types of problems that can be explored and solved with Dune. The guide is useful for anyone who wants to understand the potential of the Dune platform and how it can be used to generate insights for themselves, their projects, or their organizations.",
