  "summary": "# Sector Dashboards\n\nThis technical guide covers the Sector Dashboards feature of the Dune Docs project. Sector Dashboards provide an overview of an entire sector of the crypto economy and allow users to analyze what's happening in real-time. The purpose of this guide is to explain how Sector Dashboards work and provide examples of how they can be used.\n\nThe guide starts with an overview of Sector Dashboards and their purpose. It then provides examples of three different Sector Dashboards: Dex Metrics, Indices, and Lending. Each example includes a link to the dashboard and a brief explanation of what it shows.\n\nThe Dex Metrics dashboard provides data on the entire Decentralized Exchange sector, including metrics like Dex Volume, Market Share, and Total Volume across all exchanges. The dashboard is maintained by the community, and new DEXes can be added by submitting code to the public GitHub.\n\nThe Indices dashboard covers the entire state of a sector in one glance, allowing users to compare different products and projects with ease. It provides data on the AUM (Assets Under Management) of different indices and projects.\n\nThe Lending dashboard allows users to easily check the state of lending as a sector and compare protocol performance. It provides data on lending deposits and borrowers.\n\nOverall, this guide provides an introduction to Sector Dashboards and how they can be used to analyze different sectors of the crypto economy. The examples provided demonstrate the usefulness of Sector Dashboards in providing real-time data and insights into different sectors.",

What data sources are used to populate the sector dashboards?\n   - The app technical guide does not provide information on the data sources used to populate the sector dashboards.\n2. Can the community add new sectors to the dashboard, or is it limited to the ones already included?\n   - The app technical guide mentions that new DEXes can be added to the dashboard by submitting their code to the public GitHub, but it does not specify if new sectors can be added in the same way.\n3. Is there any integration with blockchain or SQL databases to provide real-time data updates?\n   - The app technical guide does not mention any integration with blockchain or SQL databases to provide real-time data updates."
