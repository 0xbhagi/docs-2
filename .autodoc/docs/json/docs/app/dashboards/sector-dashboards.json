  "summary": "# Sector Dashboards\n\nThe Sector Dashboards feature of the Dune Docs project allows users to get an overview of an entire sector of the crypto economy and analyze what's happening in real-time. This guide provides an overview of the Sector Dashboards feature and how it can be used to evaluate different sectors of the crypto economy.\n\nThe guide provides examples of different sector-based Dune Dashboards, including Dex Metrics, Indices, and Lending. Each of these dashboards provides an overview of the entire state of a sector in one glance, making it easy to compare different products and projects with ease.\n\nThe Dex Metrics dashboard, for example, provides metrics like Dex Volume, Market Share, and Total Volume across all exchanges, along with many more stats. All of these stats and charts update in real-time and are maintained by the community. If a new DEX wants to be added to this Dashboard, all they have to do is submit their code to the public GitHub.\n\nSimilarly, the Indices dashboard allows users to evaluate the entire state of a sector in one glance to compare different products and projects with ease. The Lending dashboard provides an overview of the state of lending protocols, making it easy to compare protocol performance.\n\nOverall, the Sector Dashboards feature of the Dune Docs project provides users with a powerful tool for evaluating different sectors of the crypto economy. By providing an overview of the entire state of a sector in one glance, users can easily compare different products and projects with ease.",
  "questions": "1. What data sources does Dune Docs use to gather information for the Sector Dashboards?\n- This information is not provided in the app technical guide, so a blockchain SQL analyst may need to investigate further or reach out to the Dune Docs team for clarification.\n\n2. How frequently are the stats and charts on the Sector Dashboards updated?\n- The app technical guide states that the stats and charts update in real time, but a blockchain SQL analyst may want to confirm the frequency of updates to ensure the data is up-to-date.\n\n3. Can new sectors be added to the Sector Dashboards, or are they limited to the ones currently available?\n- The app technical guide mentions that new DEXes can be added to the Dex Metrics Dashboard, but it is unclear if new sectors can be added as well. A blockchain SQL analyst may want to investigate further or reach out to the Dune Docs team for more information."
