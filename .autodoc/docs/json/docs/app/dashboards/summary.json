      "summary": "# How To Create a Dashboard\n\nThis technical guide covers the process of creating a dashboard on Dune, which is where the app's content lives and gets discovered. Dashboards consist of widgets, which can either be visualizations or text boxes. It is also possible to embed images or GIFs inside of the text box. The guide explains how to create a dashboard, add visualizations, add text boxes, and arrange the layout of the dashboard.\n\nTo create a new dashboard, navigate to the \"Discover\" page and click on the \"new Dashboard\" button on the right. The initial name that you give to your dashboard will also be the URL slug. You can't change the URL slug afterwards, so be mindful of the name you choose. Changing the dashboard's display name is always possible though.\n\nVisualizations can be added to the dashboard by going into the editor mode and clicking on the corresponding button. To go into editor mode, first open one of your own dashboards and click on the edit button on the top right.\n\nText boxes can be added to the dashboard by going into editor mode and clicking on \"add text widget\". This will open a simple text editor window. Text boxes support a subset of markdown, which is explained in the guide. You can manipulate text and embed images and GIFs.\n\nThe guide also explains how to embed images and GIFs into the dashboard. Since images cannot be stored locally on Dune's servers, you need to upload your images somewhere else or find the raw file somewhere on the internet. The syntax for embedding images is also explained in the guide.\n\nFinally, the guide explains how to arrange the different widgets on the dashboard in whatever way you like. Widgets will always try to move upwards, so if you want to create a visual divider section in your dashboard, it is advised to create a big text box as a divider.\n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to create a dashboard on Dune, including adding visualizations, text boxes, and images/GIFs, as well as arranging the layout of the dashboard. The guide is accompanied by examples and screenshots to make the process easier to understand.",

This dashboard provides data on average gas spent per transaction, gas limit, gas spent in total in a block, and more. The dashboard is designed to be easy to view and understand, and it is accessible through Dune. Two screenshots of the dashboard are provided as examples.\n\nThe second section of the guide focuses on DeFi Adoption, which is a dashboard created by @rchen8. This dashboard compiles user numbers from all important DeFi protocols into one place. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide users with a way to easily track DeFi adoption over time. A screenshot of the dashboard is provided as an example.\n\nOverall, the Ecosystem Dashboards feature of the Dune app is designed to provide users with a way to explore and discover general ecosystem-level metrics related to blockchain data. The Gas Prices and DeFi Adoption dashboards are two examples of the types of metrics that can be explored using this feature.",
      "questions": "1. What blockchain data is available in Dune and how is it organized? \n2.

      "summary": "# Use Cases\n\nThe app technical guide for Dune Docs covers the use cases of the Dune platform, which is a blockchain data analytics platform. The guide explains that Dune serves three different groups: Dune Spectators, Dune Wizards, and Dune Patrons. Dune Spectators can view on-chain data via dashboards on Dune.com. Dune Wizards take the raw data and use it to tell stories via dashboards, visualizations, and queries. Dune Patrons leverage Dune's powers to solve problems and share insights within their organizations.\n\nThe guide goes on to explain that nearly the entire world of blockchain data analytics can be explored with Dune, and there aren't many limitations to what you can query and visualize with Dune. However, to help users get a clearer picture of the type of problems they can explore and solve with Dune, the guide establishes a few broad use cases: Project Dashboards, Sector Dashboards, and Ecosystem Dashboards.\n\nThe guide also provides a link to Dune's Twitter account, where users can follow and see how people are currently using Dune. \n\nOverall, this guide provides an overview of the Dune platform and its capabilities. It explains the different groups that can benefit from using Dune and the types of problems that can be explored and solved with Dune. The guide is useful for anyone who wants to understand the potential of the Dune platform and how it can be used to generate insights for themselves, their projects, or their organizations.",

      "summary": "# Project Dashboards\n\nThe Project Dashboards technical guide explains how to use this feature to track the metrics of a project. The guide is focused on the app folder of the Dune Docs project. \n\nThe guide starts by explaining that Project Dashboards allow users to easily assemble data on their favorite project in one place without having to maintain infrastructure or overhead. Users can query for the data they desire and assemble it on a Dashboard to make a Datahub for their project reality. \n\nThe guide then provides an example of a Project Dashboard for Tornado.Cash by @poma. The Dashboard shows important metrics for the protocol, such as total deposits and unique users, in an easy-to-understand format. The Dashboard also includes historical data points that show the growth in users and volume. \n\nThe guide concludes by directing users to the Dune Projects Page, where they can find many other great Dashboards. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a high-level overview of how to use Project Dashboards to track project metrics.
