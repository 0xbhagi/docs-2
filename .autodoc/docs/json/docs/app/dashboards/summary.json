      "summary": "# Dune Docs Use Cases\n\nThis technical guide provides an overview of Dune, a blockchain data analytics platform, and its use cases. The guide is divided into two main sections: an introduction to Dune and its user groups, and a list of broad use cases for the platform.\n\n## Introduction to Dune\n\nDune is an open platform that serves three main user groups: Dune Spectators, Dune Wizards, and Dune Patrons. Dune Spectators can view on-chain data through dashboards on Dune.com. Dune Wizards use the raw data ingested by the Dune Platform to create dashboards, visualizations, and queries. Dune Patrons, including crypto communities, protocols, and companies, leverage Dune's powers to solve problems and share insights within their organizations.\n\n## Dune Use Cases\n\nDune can be used to explore nearly the entire world of blockchain data analytics. The guide provides three broad use cases for Dune:\n\n- Project Dashboards: Dashboards that provide insights into specific blockchain projects.\n- Sector Dashboards: Dashboards that provide insights into specific sectors of the blockchain industry.\n- Ecosystem Dashboards: Dashboards that provide insights into the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe guide notes that there are few limitations to what can be queried and visualized with Dune.\n\n## Dune Content\n\nTo get more insights into how people use Dune, the guide recommends following Dune's Twitter account, where the most interesting things that happen on Dune are retweeted. The guide provides a link to Dune's Twitter account and timeline.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a high-level overview of Dune and its use cases. It is useful for anyone interested in using Dune for blockchain data analytics, particularly those interested in creating dashboards, visualizations, and queries.",

It then goes on to explain that you can simply query for the data you desire and assemble it on a Dashboard to make a Datahub for your project Reality. This means that users can easily view and understand important data about their project without having to go through multiple sources.\n\nThe guide then provides an example of a Project Dashboard for Tornado.Cash by @poma. The Dashboard shows many important metrics for the protocol, all in one place. The guide explains that @poma wanted to show a few \"at a glance\" counters which make important data like total deposits and unique users easy to view and understand by just about anyone. @poma follows this up with some interesting historical data points which show the growth in users and volume. The Dashboard continues, but you can clearly already see how much value these stats and charts can produce for a company, protocol, or community.\n\nFinally, the guide provides a link to the Dune Projects Page where users can find many other great Dashboards.
