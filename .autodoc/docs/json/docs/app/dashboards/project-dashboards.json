  "summary": "# Project Dashboards\n\nThe Project Dashboards technical guide explains how to use this feature to track the metrics of a project. The guide is focused on the app folder of the Dune Docs project. \n\nThe guide starts by explaining that Project Dashboards allow users to easily assemble data on their favorite project in one place without having to maintain infrastructure or overhead. Users can query for the data they desire and assemble it on a Dashboard to make a Datahub for their project reality. \n\nThe guide then provides an example of a Project Dashboard for Tornado.Cash by @poma. The Dashboard shows important metrics for the protocol, such as total deposits and unique users, in an easy-to-understand format. The Dashboard also includes historical data points that show the growth in users and volume. \n\nThe guide concludes by directing users to the Dune Projects Page, where they can find many other great Dashboards. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a high-level overview of how to use Project Dashboards to track project metrics. It also provides a concrete example of how to use this feature in practice.",
  "questions": "1. What kind of data sources does this app support for assembling project dashboards?\n- The app technical guide mentions that users can \"simply query for the data you desire\" without having to maintain infrastructure or overhead, but it does not specify what kind of data sources are supported.\n\n2. Can this app be integrated with blockchain data sources?\n- The app technical guide does not mention anything about blockchain data sources specifically, so a blockchain SQL analyst might wonder if this app can be integrated with blockchain data sources.\n\n3. Are there any limitations to the types of metrics that can be tracked on a project dashboard?\n- The app technical guide does not mention any limitations to the types of metrics that can be tracked on a project dashboard, but a blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any restrictions or limitations to the types of data that can be displayed on a dashboard."
