  "summary": "# Dune API Technical Guide\n\nThe Dune API Technical Guide is a documentation for developers who want to use the Dune API. The guide provides an overview of the API and how it works, as well as instructions on how to get started with the API. \n\nThe guide starts with an introduction to the Dune API, which gives developers full access to the queries and data available on the Dune website. The API allows users to execute and read results from any public query, as well as any personal private queries that their Dune account has access to. The guide also provides a link to the Discord channel where developers can ask questions or provide feedback.\n\nThe guide then explains how the API works, which includes executing a query, checking the status of an execution, and getting the results of an execution. The results are stored separately from anything visible on the Dune website, so the only way to get query results from the Dune API is to execute a query using the API. The results from API executions are not currently reflected on Duneâ€™s website.\n\nThe guide provides instructions on how to get started with the API, which includes obtaining an API key after purchasing an app plan and API package. The API key can be found in the user's settings page. The guide also provides quick start guides for Python and Node.js, as well as links to community clients available for the API.\n\nFinally, the guide provides important links to the API documentation, the Discord channel, and the API client (community sourced). \n\nOverall, the Dune API Technical Guide is a comprehensive documentation that provides developers with all the information they need to use the Dune API.",
