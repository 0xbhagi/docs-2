  "summary": "# Community Clients\n\nThis guide provides a list of Dune API clients built by the community. It is focused on the `app` folder of the Dune Docs project. The purpose of this guide is to showcase the various API clients built by the community and provide instructions on how to install them. \n\nThe guide starts with a brief introduction to the API clients and a call to action for the community to share their own clients. It also includes a warning disclaimer that the clients are not directly maintained by the Dune team.\n\nThe guide then proceeds to list the various API clients available, including the Cow Protocol Python Client, Cow Protocol Typescript Client, Dune Go Client, and Dune Ruby Client. Each client is introduced with a brief description and the name of the developer who built it. The guide also includes links to the respective GitHub pages and installation instructions for each client.\n\nFor example, the Cow Protocol Python Client can be installed with a simple pip install command:\n\n```python\npip install dune-client\n```\n\nThe guide also includes a link to the client's GitHub page for more information on how it works. Similarly, the Dune Ruby Client can be installed by adding the following line to the Gemfile:\n\n```ruby\ngem \"dune\"\n```\n\nAnd then running `$ bundle install` from the terminal.\n\nOverall, this guide serves as a helpful resource for developers looking to use Dune API clients built by the community. It provides clear installation instructions and links to the relevant GitHub pages for more information.",
