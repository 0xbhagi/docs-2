  "summary": "# API Quick Start\n\nThis technical guide covers the quick start guides for using the API in the Dune Docs project. The purpose of this guide is to provide users with the necessary information to get started with the API quickly. \n\nThe guide starts by providing a link to example queries that can be used with the API. These queries include NFT or ERC20 balances or holders. This section is useful for users who want to quickly test the API and see how it works.\n\nThe guide also provides a link to a pipeline setup using Python and Celery. This section is useful for users who want to set up an ingestion pipeline and need guidance on how to do so.\n\nThe main section of the guide provides quick start guides for using the API with Python, Javascript, and community clients. These guides provide step-by-step instructions on how to get started with the API using these programming languages. \n\nFor example, the Python guide covers how to install the necessary packages, how to authenticate with the API, and how to make requests. The Javascript guide covers how to make requests using the fetch API and how to handle responses. The community clients guide covers how to use community-built clients to interact with the API.\n\nOverall, this technical guide is a useful resource for users who want to get started with the API quickly and efficiently. The guide provides clear and concise instructions for using the API with different programming languages and includes links to example queries and pipeline setups.",
