  "summary": "# API Ready Queries\n\nThis technical guide provides a list of queries that are ready for API use in the Dune Docs project. The guide contains four queries, each with a unique query ID that can be used in any of the API guides or can be forked and modified to create a new query ID for use in the API. \n\n## Get the ERC20 balances for a given address\n\nThis query provides the ERC20 token balances for a given address. The query ID is 1616880, and it requires the following parameters:\n\n- `address`: The address that you would like to get balances for. It must be a valid EVM address.\n- `blocknumber`: The cutoff block for checking balances. Use 0 if you want the most recent block, otherwise any block number that has been processed will work (~3 minute/15 block delay).\n- `chain`: The EVM chain you'd like to check balances for. Valid choices include `ethereum`, `polygon`, `bnb`, `optimism`, `arbitrum`, `avalanche_c`, and `gnosis`.\n- `dust`: Keep or remove dust tokens (worth less than $0.01). Valid choices are `keep` or `remove`.\n\nThe output columns include:\n\n- `symbol`: The token symbol, if available.\n- `notional_value`: The notional amount of tokens held, rounded to 5 decimals.\n- `total_value`: The $USD value of tokens held, rounded to 3 decimals.\n- `token_price`: The $USD price of the token.\n\n## Get all the holders and their balances for a given ERC20 address\n\nThis query provides all the holders and their balances for a given ERC20 address. The query ID is 1618116, and it requires the following parameters:\n\n- `address`: The ERC20 token address you would like to get holders of. It must be a valid EVM address.\n- `blocknumber`: The cutoff block for checking balances. Use 0 if you want the most recent block, otherwise any block number that has been processed will work (~3 minute/15 block delay).\n- `chain`: The EVM chain you'd like to check balances for. Valid choices include `ethereum`, `polygon`, `bnb`, `optimism`, `arbitrum`, `avalanche_c`, and `gnosis`.\n\nThe output columns include:\n\n- `holder`: The address of the holder.\n- `holder_ens`: The ENS of the holder address, if any.\n- `notional_value`: The notional amount of tokens held, rounded to 5 decimals.\n- `total_value`: The $USD value of tokens held, rounded to 3 decimals.\n- `token_price`: The $USD price of the token.\n\n## Get the NFT balances for a given address\n\nThis query provides the NFT balances for a given address. The query ID is 1617158, and it requires the following parameters:\n\n- `address`: The address that you would like to get balances for. It must be a valid EVM address.\n- `blocknumber`: The cutoff block for checking balances. Use 0 if you want the most recent block, otherwise any block number that has been processed will work (~3 minute/15 block delay).\n- `chain`: The EVM chain you'd like to check balances for. Valid choices include `ethereum`, `polygon`, `bnb`, `optimism`, `arbitrum`, `avalanche_c`, and `gnosis`.\n\nThe output columns include:\n\n- `symbol`: The symbol of the NFT, if available.\n- `name`: The name of the NFT, if available.\n- `category`: The category of the NFT, if available.\n- `token_id`: The token ID of the NFT.\n- `contract_address`: The contract address of the NFT.\n- `acquired_how`: Whether the NFT was `minted` or `transferred/bought`.\n- `acquired_on_block_number`: The block number that the NFT was received on.\n\n## Get all the holders and their balances for a given NFT address\n\nThis query provides all the holders and their balances for a given NFT address. The query ID is 1618122, and it requires the following parameters:\n\n- `address`: The NFT address that you would like to get holders of. It must be a valid EVM address.\n- `blocknumber`: The cutoff block for checking balances. Use 0 if you want the most recent block, otherwise any block number that has been processed will work (~3 minute/15 block delay).\n- `chain`: The EVM chain you'd like to check balances for. Valid choices include `ethereum`, `polygon`, `bnb`, `optimism`, `arbitrum`, `avalanche_c`, and `gnosis`.\n\nThe output columns include:\n\n- `holder`: The address of the holder.\n- `holder_ens`: The ENS of the holder address, if any.\n- `tokens_held`: The number of NFTs from this contract held.\n- `token_ids`: An array of all the token IDs held.",
  "questions": "1. What are the valid choices for the `chain` parameter in each of the queries?\n- Valid choices for the `chain` parameter in each of the queries are `ethereum`, `polygon`, `bnb`, `optimism`, `arbitrum`, `avalanche_c`, and `gnosis`.\n\n2. What is the delay between block processing and when the `blocknumber` parameter can be used in each of the queries?\n- The delay between block processing and when the `blocknumber` parameter can be used in each of the queries is approximately 3 minutes or 15 blocks.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `notional_value` and `total_value` output columns in each of the queries?\n- The `notional_value` output column in each of the queries represents the notional amount of tokens or NFTs held, rounded to 5 decimals. The `total_value` output column represents the $USD value of tokens or NFTs held, rounded to 3 decimals."
