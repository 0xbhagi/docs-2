  "summary": "The app technical guide provides a tutorial on how to access the Dune API via JavaScript. The guide is not yet comprehensive, and users are advised to reach out to the Dune team via the dune-api channel on Discord if they have any questions. The guide assumes that users have some level of familiarity with Node.js, Node Package Manager (NPM), and Node Version Manager (NVM). \n\nThe guide provides a step-by-step process for getting set up, which includes ensuring that users are using the current LTS version of Node.js (Node 18) and the latest version of NPM. Users are also required to install the node-fetch package and create a project directory and initiate an ESM-compatible Node project. \n\nThe guide provides an example Dune API script that fetches a small set of data using a simple query with the query_id 1258228. Users are required to replace `#! YOUR_API_KEY` with their Dune API key in the code. The guide also provides an example Dune API script for a parameterized query that takes in a wallet address as a parameter. \n\nThe guide concludes by providing instructions on how to run the script from the command line and a link to the code in a Github repository. The guide is focused on the app folder of the Dune Docs project and provides a detailed explanation of how to access the Dune API via JavaScript.",
