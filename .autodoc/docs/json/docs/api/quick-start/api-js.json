  "summary": "This app technical guide provides a step-by-step guide on how to access the Dune API via JavaScript. The guide is not yet comprehensive, but it provides a starting point for developers who want to use the Dune API. The guide assumes that the reader has some level of familiarity with Node.js, Node Package Manager (NPM), and Node Version Manager (NVM). \n\nThe guide starts by showing one of the several ways the API can be consumed via JavaScript, using the `node-fetch` package. The guide also mentions that developers can use the native fetch functionality available in the newest LTS version of node, node 18. The guide provides an example of how to set up the environment and install the necessary packages. \n\nThe guide then provides an example of how to call the Dune API using a simple query that fetches a small set of data. The example query has the `query_id`, `1258228`. The guide shows how to replace `#! YOUR_API_KEY` with the Dune API key and add it to the `main.js` file in the project. The guide also provides an example of how to call a parameterized query that takes in a wallet address as a parameter. The example query has the `query_id`, `1258228`, and the guide shows how to pass an example address as a value to the `wallet_address` parameter. \n\nThe guide concludes by showing how to run the script from the command line and how to edit the Query URL to fetch data from any other Queries. The guide also provides a link to a Github repository where developers can find some code from the tutorial. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a useful starting point for developers who want to use the Dune API via JavaScript. The guide is easy to follow and provides clear examples of how to call the API using simple and parameterized queries.",
  "questions": "1. What is the Dune API and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide explains how to access the Dune API via JavaScript, but it does not provide information on what the Dune API is or how it relates to blockchain technology.\n\n2. Are there any security measures in place to protect user data when using the Dune API?\n- The app technical guide does not mention any security measures in place to protect user data when using the Dune API, which may be a concern for a blockchain SQL analyst.\n\n3. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the types of queries that can be executed using the Dune API?\n- The app technical guide provides examples of simple and parameterized queries that can be executed using the Dune API, but it does not mention any limitations or restrictions on the types of queries that can be executed."
