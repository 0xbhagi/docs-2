  "summary": "The app technical guide covers the process of canceling execution requests in the Dune API. The guide is located in the `app` folder of the Dune Docs project. The guide provides a detailed explanation of how to cancel an execution request, including the arguments required, the expected return value, and examples of how to make a request using cURL or a POST request. \n\nThe guide starts with a brief introduction to the Cancel Execution API, followed by a header for the POST request method. The POST request method is used to cancel an execution request. The header provides a brief description of the method and what it does. \n\nThe next header is Arguments, which explains that no arguments are required for the Cancel Execution API. \n\nThe Returns header explains that the API returns a boolean value indicating whether the execution was successfully canceled. \n\nThe Example Request header provides an example of how to make a request to the Cancel Execution API. The example shows how to pass the `execution_id` obtained from making an Execute Query ID POST request to complete a Cancel Execution API request. \n\nThe cURL header provides an example of how to make a request using cURL. The example shows how to use the `-X POST` flag to specify the POST request method, and how to pass the `execution_id` and `api_key` as parameters. \n\nThe Example Response header provides an example of what the response from the Cancel Execution API looks like. The response is delivered in JSON format and contains a `success` boolean value indicating whether the request to cancel the query execution was made successfully. \n\nOverall, the Cancel Execution API technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of how to cancel execution requests in the Dune API. The guide is useful for developers who need to cancel execution requests and provides clear examples of how to make requests using different methods.",
