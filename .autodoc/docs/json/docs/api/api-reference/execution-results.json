  "summary": "This technical guide covers how to get the results data of an execution request in the Dune Docs project. The guide provides information on how to use the Execution Results API to retrieve the status, metadata, and query results from a query execution. The guide includes a detailed explanation of the arguments and returns of the API, as well as an example request and response in JSON and CSV formats. \n\nThe guide also provides information on the different properties of the query execution, such as the execution ID, query ID, state, submitted_at, expires_at, execution_started_at, and execution_ended_at. Additionally, the guide explains the properties of the result, including rows and metadata, such as column_names, result_set_bytes, total_row_count, datapoint_count, pending_time_millis, and execution_time_millis. \n\nThe guide also includes a FAQ section that answers common questions about reading results data, such as whether data can be ingested by getting a direct connection to the database, whether query results data are saved for faster retrieval, how long the results data from an execution are stored for, and how much data can be retrieved in a single API result call. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the Execution Results API to retrieve query execution results in the Dune Docs project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Dune Docs app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n   \n   Answer: The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of the Dune Docs app or its relation to blockchain technology. Further documentation or context is needed to answer this question.\n\n2. How does the app handle security and authentication for API requests, particularly for sensitive data related to blockchain transactions?\n   \n   Answer: The app technical guide does not provide information on security and authentication for API requests. Further documentation or context is needed to answer this question.\n\n3. What is the maximum number of rows or datapoints that can be retrieved in a single API result call, and how does this limit impact the app's usability for analyzing large datasets related to blockchain transactions?\n   \n   Answer: The app technical guide states that there is currently a 1GB limit on the amount of data that can be retrieved in a single API result call. However, it is unclear how this limit impacts the app's usability for analyzing large datasets related to blockchain transactions. Further documentation or context is needed to answer this question."
