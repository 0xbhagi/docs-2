  "summary": "# Explanation of the App Technical Guide\n\nThe app technical guide is a documentation for the Dune Docs project, which explains how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. The guide is focused on the `query` folder of the project. \n\nThe guide starts with a header that explains the purpose of the file, which is to execute a query ID. The header is followed by a section that explains how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. \n\nThe next section of the guide explains the arguments required to execute the query. In this case, no arguments are required, but query parameters can be added optionally. The guide provides an example of how to add query parameters using cURL. \n\nThe guide then explains what the API returns when the query is executed. In this case, the API returns an `execution_id` for the specified request. The guide provides an example of what the response looks like in JSON format. \n\nThe guide also provides an example request using cURL to execute the query. The example request includes the API endpoint and the query ID. The guide also provides an example of how to execute the query with parameters using cURL. \n\nFinally, the guide explains what the `execution_id` and `state` mean in the response. The `execution_id` is a unique ID that is generated every time the API is called, and the `state` is the current state of the query's execution. \n\nOverall, the app technical guide provides a detailed explanation of how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. The guide is focused on the `query` folder of the Dune Docs project and provides examples of how to use cURL to execute the query.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `execution_id` returned by the API?\n   \n   The `execution_id` is a unique ID generated every time the API is called, and it can be saved to pass on to other API endpoints.\n\n2. Can this API be used to execute queries on a blockchain database?\n   \n   The app technical guide does not provide information on whether this API can be used to execute queries on a blockchain database or not.\n\n3. Are there any limitations on the number or size of query parameters that can be passed to the API?\n   \n   The app technical guide does not provide information on any limitations on the number or size of query parameters that can be passed to the API."
