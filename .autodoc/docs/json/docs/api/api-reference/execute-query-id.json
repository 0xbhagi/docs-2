  "summary": "# Explanation of the Dune Docs App Technical Guide\n\n## Execute Query ID\n\nThis section of the guide explains how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. The guide is focused on the `query` folder of the project. \n\n### [POST] Execute Query ID\n\nThis header explains that the method to execute a query is a POST request. \n\n### Arguments\n\nThis section explains that no arguments are required to execute a query. However, it is possible to add query parameters to the request. An example of how to add query parameters is provided in the guide. \n\n### Returns\n\nThis section explains that the API returns an `execution_id` for the specified request. \n\n### Example Request\n\nThis section provides an example of how to make a request to execute a query. The example shows the URL to use for the request. \n\n#### cURL\n\nThis section provides an example of how to make a request using cURL. The example shows the command to use for the request. \n\n#### cURL with Parameters\n\nThis section provides an example of how to make a request with query parameters using cURL. The example shows the command to use for the request. \n\n### Example Response\n\nThis section provides an example of the response that the API returns when a query is executed. The response is delivered in JSON format and contains an `execution_id` and a `state`. The `execution_id` is a unique ID that is generated every time the API is called. The `state` is the current state of the query's execution. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a step-by-step explanation of how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. It also provides examples of how to make requests and what responses to expect.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `execution_id` returned by the API?\n   \n   The `execution_id` is a unique ID generated every time the API is called, which can be saved and passed on to other API endpoints.\n\n2. Can this API be used to execute queries on a blockchain database?\n   \n   The technical guide does not provide information on whether this API can be used to execute queries on a blockchain database or not.\n\n3. Are there any limitations on the size or complexity of the queries that can be executed using this API?\n   \n   The technical guide does not provide information on any limitations on the size or complexity of the queries that can be executed using this API."
