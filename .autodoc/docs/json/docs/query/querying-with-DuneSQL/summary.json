      "summary": "The app technical guide provided describes the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by DuneSQL. These functions and operators allow for the implementation of complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources. \n\nThe guide provides links to a full alphabetical list and a full list by topic of the available functions and operators. Additionally, using SHOW FUNCTIONS returns a list of all available functions, including custom functions, with all supported arguments and a short description. \n\nThe guide also recommends reviewing the SQL data types and the SQL statement and syntax reference. \n\nEach header in the guide corresponds to a specific category of functions and operators, such as Aggregate, Array, Binary, Bitwise, Color, Comparison, Conditional, Conversion, Date and time, Decimal, Geospatial, HyperLogLog, IP Address, JSON, Lambda, Logical, Machine learning, Map, Math, Quantile digest, Regular expression, Session, Set Digest, String, System, Table, Teradata, T-Digest, URL, UUID, and Window. \n\nFor example, the Aggregate header provides a link to the Trino documentation on aggregate functions, which are used to perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. The Array header provides a link to the Trino documentation on array functions, which are used to manipulate arrays. \n\nOverall, this guide serves as a reference for developers working with DuneSQL to understand the available SQL functions and operators and how to use them effectively in their code.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of DuneSQL and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of DuneSQL or its relation to blockchain technology.\n\n2. Are there any specific SQL functions or operators that are particularly useful for analyzing blockchain data?\n- The app technical guide provides a list of built-in SQL functions and operators supported by DuneSQL, but does not specify any that are particularly useful for analyzing blockchain data.\n\n3. Does DuneSQL support any specialized data types or functions for working with blockchain-specific data structures, such as Merkle trees or cryptographic hashes?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on whether DuneSQL supports specialized data types or functions for working with blockchain-specific data structures."

  "summary": "The guide in the `functions-and-operators.md` file covers the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by DuneSQL, which is a part of the larger project feature \"query.\" This guide is essential for developers working with DuneSQL to understand the available SQL functions and operators and how to use them effectively in their code. It provides a comprehensive list of functions and operators, categorized by their specific use cases, such as Aggregate, Array, Binary, Bitwise, Color, Comparison, Conditional, Conversion, Date and time, Decimal, Geospatial, HyperLogLog, IP Address, JSON, Lambda, Logical, Machine learning, Map, Math, Quantile digest, Regular expression, Session, Set Digest, String, System, Table, Teradata, T-Digest, URL, UUID, and Window.\n\nFor example, if a developer is working on a feature that requires manipulating arrays, they can refer to the Array header in the guide, which provides a link to the Trino documentation on array functions. This will help them understand how to use the available functions to manipulate arrays effectively.\n\nSimilarly, if a developer needs to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value, they can refer to the Aggregate header in the guide. This header provides a link to the Trino documentation on aggregate functions, which will help them understand how to use these functions in their code.\n\nThe guide also provides information on how to use the SHOW FUNCTIONS command to return a list of all available functions, including custom functions, with all supported arguments and a short description. This can be useful for developers who want to explore the available functions and their usage in their code.\n\nIn addition to the categorized list of functions and operators, the guide recommends reviewing the SQL data types and the SQL statement and syntax reference. This will help developers gain a better understanding of the data types they are working with and how to write efficient SQL queries using DuneSQL.\n\nOverall, this guide serves as a valuable reference for developers working with DuneSQL in the larger project feature \"query.\" It helps them understand the available SQL functions and operators, their usage, and how to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources.",
