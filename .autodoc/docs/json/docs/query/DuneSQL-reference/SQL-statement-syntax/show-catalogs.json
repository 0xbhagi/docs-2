  "summary": "The app technical guide covers the `SHOW CATALOGS` feature of the project app. This feature allows users to list the available catalogs. The `Synopsis` section provides the syntax for the feature, which is `SHOW CATALOGS [ LIKE pattern ]`. The `Description` section explains how to use the optional `LIKE` clause to filter the results to a desired subset. An example is given to illustrate how to find catalogs that begin with a specific letter or pattern. \n\nThis feature is useful for users who need to quickly view the available catalogs in the app. By using the `LIKE` clause, users can filter the results to a specific subset of catalogs, which can save time and make it easier to find the desired catalog. \n\nExample: \n\nTo list all available catalogs, the user can simply enter `SHOW CATALOGS` in the app. \n\nTo find catalogs that begin with the letter \"t\", the user can enter `SHOW CATALOGS LIKE 't%'`. This will return a list of all catalogs that start with the letter \"t\". \n\nOverall, the `SHOW CATALOGS` feature is a helpful tool for users to quickly view and filter the available catalogs in the app.",
