  "summary": "# ANALYZE\n\nThe `ANALYZE` command is used to collect table and column statistics for a given table. This section of the app technical guide provides a synopsis, description, and examples of how to use the `ANALYZE` command.\n\nThe synopsis provides the basic syntax of the `ANALYZE` command, which includes the table name and an optional `WITH` clause that can be used to provide connector-specific properties. \n\nThe description explains that the `ANALYZE` command is used to collect table and column statistics for a given table. It also provides information on how to use the optional `WITH` clause to specify connector-specific properties. To list all available properties, the guide recommends running the following query: `SELECT * FROM system.metadata.analyze_properties`.\n\nThe examples section provides several examples of how to use the `ANALYZE` command. These examples include analyzing a table, analyzing a table in a specific catalog and schema, analyzing partitions from a partitioned table, and analyzing specific columns for partitions from a partitioned table. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use the `ANALYZE` command to collect table and column statistics for a given table. It also provides helpful examples to illustrate how to use the command in different scenarios.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ANALYZE` command in this app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The `ANALYZE` command collects table and column statistics for a given table, which may be useful for optimizing queries and improving performance. It is not directly related to blockchain technology, but could be used in conjunction with a blockchain database to analyze data stored on the chain.\n\n2. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the types of tables or data that can be analyzed using this command?\n- The app technical guide does not mention any specific limitations or restrictions on the types of tables or data that can be analyzed using the `ANALYZE` command. However, it may be worth investigating whether certain data formats or structures are better suited for analysis than others.\n\n3. How can the optional `WITH` clause be used to provide connector-specific properties, and what are some examples of these properties?\n- The `WITH` clause can be used to provide connector-specific properties that may affect how the `ANALYZE` command operates. Examples of these properties include `partitions` (to specify which partitions to analyze), `columns` (to specify which columns to analyze), and `sample_size` (to control the size of the sample used for analysis). The full list of available properties can be obtained by running the query `SELECT * FROM system.metadata.analyze_properties`."
