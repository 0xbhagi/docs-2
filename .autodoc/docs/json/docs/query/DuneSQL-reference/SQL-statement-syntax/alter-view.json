  "summary": "# ALTER VIEW\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThe `ALTER VIEW` command allows for the modification of an existing view in the app. The command can be used to rename a view or change the owner of a view.\n\n``` text\nALTER VIEW name RENAME TO new_name\nALTER VIEW name SET AUTHORIZATION ( user | USER user | ROLE role )\n```\n\n## Description\n\nThe `ALTER VIEW` command is used to change the definition of an existing view. This command can be used to rename a view or change the owner of a view. Renaming a view is useful when the name of the view no longer accurately reflects the data it contains. Changing the owner of a view is useful when a user or role needs to take ownership of a view.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Renaming a view\n\nTo rename a view, use the `RENAME TO` clause followed by the new name of the view. For example, to rename the `people` view to `users`, use the following command:\n\n```\nALTER VIEW people RENAME TO users\n```\n\n### Changing the owner of a view\n\nTo change the owner of a view, use the `SET AUTHORIZATION` clause followed by the name of the user or role that will become the new owner. For example, to change the owner of the `people` view to user `alice`, use the following command:\n\n```\nALTER VIEW people SET AUTHORIZATION alice\n```\n\n## See also\n\n`create-view`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the `ALTER VIEW` command, which is used to modify an existing view in the app. The guide provides a synopsis of the command, including the syntax and available options.
