  "summary": "# ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThis section provides a brief overview of the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. The command is used to rename an existing materialized view. The syntax for the command is as follows:\n\n``` text\nALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name RENAME TO new_name\nALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW name SET PROPERTIES property_name = expression [, ...]\n```\n\n## Description\n\nThis section provides a detailed explanation of the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. The command is used to change the name of an existing materialized view. The optional `IF EXISTS` clause suppresses the error if the materialized view does not exist. However, the error is not suppressed if the materialized view does not exist, but a table or view with the given name exists.\n\n### SET PROPERTIES\n\nThis section explains the `SET PROPERTIES` statement that can be used with the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. The `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW SET PROPERTIES` statement followed by some number of `property_name` and `expression` pairs applies the specified properties and values to a materialized view. Omitting an already-set property from this statement leaves that property unchanged in the materialized view. A property in a `SET PROPERTIES` statement can be set to `DEFAULT`, which reverts its value back to the default in that materialized view. However, support for `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW SET PROPERTIES` varies between connectors. Refer to the connector documentation for more details.\n\n## Examples\n\nThis section provides examples of how to use the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. The examples include:\n\n- Renaming a materialized view `people` to `users` in the current schema\n- Renaming a materialized view `people` to `users`, if materialized view `people` exists in the current catalog and schema\n- Setting view properties (`x = y`) in materialized view `people`\n- Setting multiple view properties (`foo = 123` and `foo bar = 456`) in materialized view `people`\n- Setting view property `x` to its default value in materialized view `people`\n\n## See also\n\nThis section provides links to related commands that can be used with the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. The related commands include:\n\n- `create-materialized-view`\n- `refresh-materialized-view`\n- `drop-materialized-view`",
