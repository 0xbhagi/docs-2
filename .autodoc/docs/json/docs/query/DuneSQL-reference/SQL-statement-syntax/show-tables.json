The guide provides an example of how to use the `LIKE` clause to find tables that begin with a specific letter. \n\nThe `Synopsis` section provides a brief overview of the `SHOW TABLES` command and its syntax. The `Description` section provides more detailed information on how to use the command, including the optional `FROM` and `LIKE` clauses. The section also provides an example of how to use the `LIKE` clause to filter results. \n\nOverall, this guide is useful for users who need to view a list of tables in a schema or the current schema. The `LIKE` clause provides additional flexibility for users who need to filter results to a specific subset.",
