  "summary": "# Overview\n\nThis technical guide provides an overview of DuneSQL, an ANSI SQL compliant query engine that follows the standard SQL syntax. The guide is divided into chapters that describe the SQL syntax used in Trino, a reference to the supported SQL data types, and numerous SQL functions and operators provided by Trino.\n\nThe first chapter of the guide provides a brief introduction to DuneSQL and its compliance with the ANSI SQL standard. The subsequent chapters provide a comprehensive list of SQL commands and functions supported by Trino, including:\n\n- ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW\n- ALTER SCHEMA\n- ALTER TABLE\n- ALTER VIEW\n- ANALYZE\n- CALL\n- COMMENT\n- COMMIT\n- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW\n- CREATE ROLE\n- CREATE SCHEMA\n- CREATE TABLE\n- CREATE TABLE AS\n- CREATE VIEW\n- DEALLOCATE PREPARE\n- DELETE\n- DESCRIBE\n- DESCRIBE INPUT\n- DESCRIBE OUTPUT\n- DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW\n- DROP ROLE\n- DROP SCHEMA\n- DROP TABLE\n- DROP VIEW\n- EXECUTE\n- EXPLAIN\n- EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n- GRANT\n- GRANT ROLES\n- INSERT\n- MATCH_RECOGNIZE\n- MERGE\n- Row pattern recognition in window structures\n- PREPARE\n- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW\n- RESET SESSION\n- REVOKE\n- REVOKE ROLES\n- ROLLBACK\n- SELECT\n- SET ROLE\n- SET SESSION\n- SET TIME ZONE\n- SHOW CATALOGS\n- SHOW COLUMNS\n- SHOW CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW\n- SHOW CREATE SCHEMA\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE\n- SHOW CREATE VIEW\n- SHOW FUNCTIONS\n- SHOW GRANTS\n- SHOW ROLE GRANTS\n- SHOW ROLES\n- SHOW SCHEMAS\n- SHOW SESSION\n- SHOW STATS\n- SHOW TABLES\n- START TRANSACTION\n- TRUNCATE\n- UPDATE\n- USE\n- VALUES\n\nThe guide also includes a note indicating that the section on SQL syntax may be summarized on a single page, as the project mostly uses basic SELECT statements. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive reference for developers working with DuneSQL and Trino, outlining the supported SQL commands and functions available for use in the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of DuneSQL and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on how DuneSQL relates to blockchain technology, so a blockchain SQL analyst may want to know if this tool is specifically designed for blockchain data analysis or if it can be used for any type of SQL data analysis.\n\n2. Are there any limitations or differences in the SQL syntax used in Trino compared to other SQL query engines?\n- The app technical guide mentions that it describes the SQL syntax used in Trino, so a blockchain SQL analyst may want to know if there are any limitations or differences in the SQL syntax used in Trino compared to other SQL query engines, especially if they are used to working with a different SQL syntax.\n\n3. Does DuneSQL support any specific SQL functions or operators that are commonly used in blockchain data analysis?\n- The app technical guide mentions that Trino provides numerous SQL functions and operators, but it does not specify if any of these are particularly useful for blockchain data analysis. A blockchain SQL analyst may want to know if there are any specific SQL functions or operators that are commonly used in blockchain data analysis that are supported by DuneSQL."
