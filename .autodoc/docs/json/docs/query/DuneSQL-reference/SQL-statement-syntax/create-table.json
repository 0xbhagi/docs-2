  "summary": "The `CREATE TABLE` section of the Dune Docs project is a technical guide that explains how to create a new, empty table with specified columns. The guide provides a synopsis of the syntax for creating a table, which includes the table name, column names, data types, and optional clauses such as `IF NOT EXISTS`, `COMMENT`, and `WITH`. \n\nThe `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is optional and suppresses an error if the table already exists. The `COMMENT` clause is also optional and allows the user to add a comment to the table. The `WITH` clause is used to set properties on the newly created table or on single columns. The guide provides examples of how to use the `WITH` clause to set the format of the table to 'ORC' and to add a comment to a column.\n\nThe guide also explains how to use the `LIKE` clause to include all the column definitions from an existing table in the new table. Multiple `LIKE` clauses may be specified, which allows copying the columns from multiple tables. If `INCLUDING PROPERTIES` is specified, all of the table properties are copied to the new table. If the `WITH` clause specifies the same property name as one of the copied properties, the value from the `WITH` clause will be used. The default behavior is `EXCLUDING PROPERTIES`. The `INCLUDING PROPERTIES` option maybe specified for at most one table.\n\nThe guide provides examples of how to create a new table, create a table if it does not already exist, and create a new table using the columns from an existing table plus additional columns at the start and end. \n\nOverall, the `CREATE TABLE` section of the Dune Docs project is a comprehensive guide that explains how to create a new table with specified columns and optional clauses. The guide provides examples of how to use the different clauses and options to customize the table creation process.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WITH` clause in the `CREATE TABLE` statement?\n   \n   The `WITH` clause can be used to set properties on the newly created table or on single columns.\n\n2. How can a blockchain SQL analyst list all available table properties?\n   \n   A blockchain SQL analyst can run the following query: `SELECT * FROM system.metadata.table_properties`.\n\n3. Can the `LIKE` clause be used to copy columns from multiple tables?\n   \n   Yes, multiple `LIKE` clauses may be specified, which allows copying the columns from multiple tables."
