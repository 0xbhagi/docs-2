  "summary": "# Explanation of the Dune Docs App Technical Guide\n\n## Show Functions\n\nThe `Show Functions` section of the guide explains how to list all the functions available for use in queries. The section provides a synopsis of the command, which is `SHOW FUNCTIONS [ LIKE pattern ]`. The optional `LIKE` clause can be used to filter the results to a desired subset. The section also provides a description of the information that is displayed for each function returned, which includes the function name, return type, argument types, function type, deterministic, and description.\n\nThe section provides an example of how to use the `LIKE` clause to filter the results to functions beginning with `array`. The example query is `SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE 'array%';`.\n\nThe section also explains that `SHOW FUNCTIONS` works with both built-in functions and custom functions. An example is provided of how to use the `LIKE` clause to filter the results to custom functions beginning with `cf`. The example query is `SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE 'cf%';`. The section then provides a table of the three custom functions that are available, which includes the function name, return type, argument types, function type, deterministic, and description.\n\nOverall, the `Show Functions` section of the guide provides a clear explanation of how to list all the functions available for use in queries and how to filter the results to a desired subset. The section also provides helpful examples of how to use the `LIKE` clause to filter the results to functions beginning with a specific pattern and how to filter the results to custom functions.",
