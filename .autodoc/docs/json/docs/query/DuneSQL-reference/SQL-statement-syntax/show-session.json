  "summary": "The \"Show Session\" section of the app technical guide covers the functionality of listing the current session properties in the Dune Docs app. The `SHOW SESSION` command is used to display the session properties, and an optional `LIKE` clause can be used to filter the results based on a specified pattern. The example provided in the guide shows how to use the `LIKE` clause to find session properties that begin with \"query\". \n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide users with a way to view the current session properties in the app, which can be useful for troubleshooting or debugging purposes. The guide also references other related commands, such as `reset-session` and `set-session`, which can be used to modify the session properties.\n\nOverall, this section of the guide is focused on the app folder of the Dune Docs project, specifically on the functionality related to managing and viewing session properties.",

How does the `LIKE` clause work in the `SHOW SESSION` command?\n- The blockchain SQL analyst might want to know how to use the `LIKE` clause to filter the results of the `SHOW SESSION` command based on a pattern.\n\n3. Are there any other related commands or functions that a blockchain SQL analyst should be aware of when working with sessions in the database?\n- The blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any other commands or functions that are related to managing or monitoring sessions in the database, and how they can be used in conjunction with the `SHOW SESSION` command."
