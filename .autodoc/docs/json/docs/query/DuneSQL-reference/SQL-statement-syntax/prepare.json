  "summary": "The `PREPARE` section of the app technical guide covers the functionality of preparing SQL statements for execution at a later time. This feature is located in the `app` folder of the project. The `Synopsis` section provides the syntax for the `PREPARE` statement, which takes in a statement name and the SQL statement to be prepared. \n\nThe `Description` section explains that prepared statements are queries that are saved in a session with a given name. These statements can include parameters in place of literals to be replaced at execution time. Parameters are represented by question marks. The section also provides examples of how to prepare select and insert queries with and without parameters.\n\nThe `Examples` section provides code snippets demonstrating how to prepare select and insert queries with and without parameters. The examples show how to use the `PREPARE` statement to save a select query with a given name, how to prepare a select query with parameters, and how to prepare an insert query.\n\nThe `See also` section lists related statements that can be used in conjunction with `PREPARE`, such as `execute`, `deallocate-prepare`, `describe-input`, and `describe-output`. These statements are also located in the `app` folder of the project and can be used to execute, deallocate, and describe prepared statements.\n\nOverall, the `PREPARE` section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to prepare SQL statements for execution at a later time in the project's `app` folder.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PREPARE` statement in the context of a blockchain SQL database?\n- A blockchain SQL analyst might want to know how the `PREPARE` statement can be used to optimize query performance and reduce network traffic when interacting with the blockchain database.\n\n2. Are there any security concerns related to using prepared statements in this app?\n- A blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any vulnerabilities or risks associated with using prepared statements in the app, especially if sensitive data is being queried or inserted.\n\n3. How does the `PREPARE` statement interact with other SQL commands in the app?\n- A blockchain SQL analyst might want to understand how the `PREPARE` statement fits into the overall architecture of the app and how it can be used in conjunction with other SQL commands to achieve specific goals."
