  "summary": "# Mathematical functions and operators\n\nThis technical guide covers the mathematical functions and operators available in the Dune Docs project. The guide is divided into several sections, each of which covers a specific mathematical function or operator. \n\nThe first section covers mathematical operators, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. \n\nThe second section covers mathematical functions, including `abs()`, `cbrt()`, `ceil()`, `ceiling()`, `degrees()`, `e()`, `exp()`, `floor()`, `ln()`, `log()`, `log2()`, `log10()`, `mod()`, `pi()`, `pow()`, `power()`, `radians()`, `round()`, `sign()`, `sqrt()`, `truncate()`, and `width_bucket()`. \n\nThe third section covers random functions, including `rand()`, `random()`, and `random(n)`. \n\nThe fourth section covers trigonometric functions, including `acos()`, `asin()`, `atan()`, `atan2()`, `cos()`, `cosh()`, `sin()`, `tan()`, and `tanh()`. \n\nThe fifth section covers floating point functions, including `infinity()`, `is_finite()`, `is_infinite()`, `is_nan()`, and `nan()`. \n\nThe sixth section covers base conversion functions, including `from_base()` and `to_base()`. \n\nThe seventh section covers statistical functions, including `cosine_similarity()`, `wilson_interval_lower()`, and `wilson_interval_upper()`. \n\nThe eighth section covers cumulative distribution functions, including `beta_cdf()`, `inverse_beta_cdf()`, `inverse_normal_cdf()`, and `normal_cdf()`. \n\nEach function is described in detail, including its input parameters and output format. Examples are provided where appropriate to illustrate how each function can be used. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the mathematical functions and operators available in the Dune Docs project, making it a valuable resource for developers working on this project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the dune docs app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of the dune docs app or its relation to blockchain technology.\n\n2. Are there any mathematical functions or operators that are specific to blockchain data analysis?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on whether any of the mathematical functions or operators are specific to blockchain data analysis.\n\n3. Does the app technical guide provide information on how to integrate the mathematical functions and operators into a blockchain SQL database?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on how to integrate the mathematical functions and operators into a blockchain SQL database."
