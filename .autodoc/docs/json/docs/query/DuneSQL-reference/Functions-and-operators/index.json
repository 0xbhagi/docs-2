  "summary": "The app technical guide provides an overview of the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by Trino, which is the underlying data source for the DuneSQL project. The guide is divided into sections based on the type of function or operator, such as Aggregate, Array, Binary, Bitwise, Comparison, Conditional, Conversion, Date and time, Decimal, HyperLogLog, JSON, Lambda, Logical, Map, Math, Quantile digest, Regular expression, Set Digest, String, System, Table, Teradata, T-Digest, URL, UUID, varbinary, and Window.\n\nEach section provides a high-level purpose of the functions and operators, and how they can be used to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino. The guide also includes links to full alphabetical and topic lists of functions and operators, as well as a command to show all available functions, including custom functions, with their supported arguments and a short description.\n\nThe note at the beginning of the guide indicates that this section needs to be maintained by the DuneSQL team since they are implementing their own functions and operators and changing existing ones. This suggests that the guide is intended for developers working on the DuneSQL project who need to understand the built-in functions and operators supported by Trino and how they can be used to implement the desired functionality.\n\nFor example, a developer working on the DuneSQL project may need to use the Array functions to manipulate arrays of data, or the Date and time functions to perform calculations on dates and times. The guide provides a comprehensive list of functions and operators that can be used to achieve these tasks and more. Overall, the app technical guide serves as a valuable resource for developers working on the DuneSQL project who need to understand the built-in functions and operators supported by Trino.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of DuneSQL and what underlying data sources does it operate on?\n- The app technical guide states that DuneSQL supports a wide range of built-in functions and operators and allows for implementation of complex functionality and behavior of SQL executed by Trino operating on underlying data sources. However, it does not specify what those underlying data sources are.\n\n2. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the use of custom functions in DuneSQL?\n- The note in the app technical guide mentions that the section on built-in functions and operators needs to be maintained by the team implementing custom functions and operators. A blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any specific guidelines or restrictions on the use of custom functions in DuneSQL.\n\n3. How can a user find a specific function or operator in DuneSQL?\n- The app technical guide provides links to full alphabetical and topic-based lists of functions and operators, as well as a command to show all available functions. However, a blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any additional search or filtering capabilities available to help locate a specific function or operator."
