  "summary": "This app technical guide provides a comprehensive list of functions and operators used in the project. The guide is organized alphabetically, with each letter header followed by a list of functions and operators starting with that letter.\n\nFor example, under the header `A`, you'll find functions like `abs`, `acos`, `ALL`, `all_match`, `AND`, `ANY`, `any_match`, `approx_distinct`, `approx_most_frequent`, `approx_percentile`, `approx_set`, `arbitrary`, `array_agg`, `array_distinct`, `array_except`, `array_intersect`, `array_join`, `array_max`, `array_min`, `array_position`, `array_remove`, `array_sort`, `array_union`, and `arrays_overlap`.\n\nEach function or operator is followed by a reference link, which provides more information about the specific function or operator. For instance, the `substring operator` reference link will provide more details on how to use the substring operator in the project.\n\nThe guide covers various sections of the project app, such as app, api, data-tables, query, and reference, as specified in the file path. By referring to this guide, users can quickly find the appropriate function or operator for their needs and learn how to apply them in the project app.",
  "questions": "1. **What specific functions are available for working with blockchain data in this app technical guide?**\n\n    The app technical guide provides a comprehensive list of functions and operators, but it does not specifically mention any functions tailored for blockchain data. A blockchain SQL analyst might need to use a combination of these functions to work with blockchain data.\n\n2. **Are there any functions or operators specifically designed for querying or analyzing smart contracts?**\n\n    The app technical guide does not mention any functions or operators explicitly designed for querying or analyzing smart contracts. However, a blockchain SQL analyst might be able to use the available functions and operators to analyze smart contract data.\n\n3. **How can I use the functions and operators in this app technical guide to analyze transaction data on a blockchain?**\n\n    While the app technical guide does not provide specific examples for analyzing transaction data on a blockchain, a blockchain SQL analyst can use the available functions and operators to create custom queries and analysis. For example, they can use mathematical operators, aggregation functions, and string manipulation functions to analyze transaction data and derive insights."
