  "summary": "# Logical Operators\n\nThis section of the app technical guide for the Dune Docs project covers the logical operators used in SQL. The logical operators covered in this guide are `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. The guide provides a description of each operator and an example of how to use them.\n\n## Effect of NULL on Logical Operators\n\nThis section of the guide explains how `NULL` values affect the logical operators. The guide provides examples of how `NULL` values affect the result of an `AND` or `OR` comparison. If one or both sides of an `AND` comparison are `NULL`, the result may be `NULL`. If at least one side of an `OR` comparison is `TRUE`, the result is `TRUE`. The guide also provides a truth table that demonstrates how `NULL` values are handled in `AND` and `OR` comparisons.\n\nThe guide also explains that the logical complement of `NULL` is `NULL`. The guide provides an example of how to use the `NOT` operator with a `NULL` value and a truth table that demonstrates how `NULL` values are handled in `NOT` comparisons.\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive explanation of how logical operators work in SQL and how `NULL` values affect their behavior. The examples and truth tables provided in the guide make it easy to understand how to use these operators in practice.",
