  "summary": "This app technical guide covers the binary data type and its associated functions in the Dune Docs project. The guide provides a detailed explanation of the binary operators and functions that can be used to manipulate binary data. The guide is divided into several sections, each of which covers a specific function or operator.\n\nThe first section covers binary operators, specifically the `||` operator, which performs concatenation. The following sections cover binary functions, including `concat()`, which concatenates binary data, `length()`, which returns the length of binary data in bytes, `lpad()`, which left-pads binary data with a specified number of bytes, and `rpad()`, which right-pads binary data with a specified number of bytes. The `substr()` function is also covered, which returns a substring of binary data from a specified starting position and length. Finally, the `reverse()` function is covered, which returns binary data with the bytes in reverse order.\n\nThe guide also covers several encoding functions, including base64 encoding functions such as `from_base64()`, which decodes binary data from a base64 encoded string, and `to_base64()`, which encodes binary data into a base64 string representation. The guide also covers base64url encoding functions, base32 encoding functions, hex encoding functions, and integer and floating-point encoding functions.\n\nThe guide concludes with a section on hashing functions, including `crc32()`, which computes the CRC-32 of binary data, and several functions that compute various hash values, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SpookyHashV2, and xxHash. The guide also covers HMAC functions, including `hmac_md5()`, `hmac_sha1()`, `hmac_sha256()`, and `hmac_sha512()`, which compute HMAC values for binary data with the given key.\n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the binary data type and its associated functions in the Dune Docs project. It includes detailed explanations of each function and operator, as well as examples of how to use them.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the dune docs app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of the dune docs app or its relation to blockchain technology.\n\n2. Are there any specific hashing functions that are recommended for use in blockchain applications?\n- The app technical guide mentions xxhash64() as a recommended hashing function for general purpose hashing, as it is faster and produces a better quality hash than crc32().\n\n3. Can the app handle encoding and decoding of binary data in various formats commonly used in blockchain applications?\n- Yes, the app technical guide provides functions for base64, base32, hex, and integer encoding and decoding, which are commonly used in blockchain applications."
