  "summary": "The \"Reserved Keywords\" section of the app technical guide for the Dune Docs project provides a comprehensive list of all the keywords that are reserved in Trino, along with their status in the SQL standard. These reserved keywords must be quoted (using double quotes) in order to be used as an identifier. \n\nThis section is important for developers who are working on the app feature that involves writing SQL queries. It is essential to know which keywords are reserved in Trino and must be quoted to avoid syntax errors. \n\nFor example, if a developer wants to use the keyword \"SELECT\" as a column name in a table, they must quote it as \"SELECT\" to avoid conflicts with the reserved keyword. \n\nThe table in this section lists all the reserved keywords in alphabetical order, along with their status in the SQL standard. The SQL standard status indicates whether the keyword is reserved or non-reserved in the standard. \n\nOverall, this section serves as a quick reference for developers working on the app feature that involves writing SQL queries. It helps them avoid syntax errors and ensures that their queries run smoothly.",
