  "summary": "# Overview\n\nThe Overview section of the Dune Docs app technical guide provides an introduction to DuneSQL, a custom-built query engine optimized for blockchain data. DuneSQL is built on a fork of TrinoSQL, an ANSI SQL compliant query engine that allows users to integrate their favorite data tools with any underlying data source. \n\nThe section notes that DuneSQL validates and translates SQL statements into the necessary operations on the connected data source. It also provides a reference to the supported SQL data types and other general characteristics of the SQL support of DuneSQL. \n\nThe section includes links to a full SQL statement and syntax reference, as well as a reference to numerous SQL functions and operators provided by Trino. \n\nOverall, the Overview section serves as a high-level introduction to DuneSQL and its capabilities, providing context for the more detailed technical information provided in other sections of the app technical guide. \n\nExample: \n\nIf a user is new to DuneSQL and wants to understand its capabilities and how it differs from TrinoSQL, they can start by reading the Overview section. This will provide them with a basic understanding of DuneSQL's features and how it can be used with other data tools. They can then explore the other sections of the app technical guide for more detailed information on specific aspects of DuneSQL.",
  "questions": "1. What specific optimizations does DuneSQL have for blockchain data? \n- The app technical guide does not provide specific details on the optimizations made for blockchain data.\n\n2.
