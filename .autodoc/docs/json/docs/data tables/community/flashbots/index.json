  "summary": "# Flashbots\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the Flashbots project, which is a research and development organization aimed at ensuring that MEV (Miner Extractable Value) incentives do not become opaque and undemocratic. MEV refers to the profit that miners can make by reordering, censoring, or including transactions in a block. \n\nThe guide notes that mev-inspect-py, which is Flashbots' open-source engine for generating MEV data, powers dashboards such as mev-explore and Dune's Flashbots integration. The guide encourages researchers and developers to report any bugs they find or implement new features to improve the engine. \n\nThe guide provides links to the Flashbots documentation and Discord channel for more information and updates on their data and mev-inspect. \n\nExample: If a developer is working on integrating Flashbots into their project, they can consult the Flashbots documentation to understand how to use mev-inspect-py to generate MEV data and how to integrate it into their project. They can also join the Flashbots Discord channel to ask questions and get updates on any new features or bug fixes.",
