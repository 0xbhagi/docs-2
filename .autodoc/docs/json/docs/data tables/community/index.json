  "summary": "# Community\n\nThis section of the Dune Docs project contains data that has been submitted and hosted on Dune by third-party data providers. The purpose of this section is to provide off-chain data or augmented on-chain data that may be needed in addition to blockchain data. \n\nThe section is only available on V2 Engine. The guide notes that the infrastructure for this endeavor is still being built, and therefore, the support for more datasets is not available at the moment. \n\nThe section contains two datasets, Flashbots and Reservoir, which are listed as cards in a grid format.
