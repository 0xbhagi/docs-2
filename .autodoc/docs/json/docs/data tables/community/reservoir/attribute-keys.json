  "summary": "# Attribute Keys\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the `reservoir.attribute_keys` table, which contains records with information about each attribute key. The table has seven columns, including `id`, `collection_id`, `key`, `kind`, `rank`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. \n\n- `id`: This column contains the internal attribute key id.\n- `collection_id`: This column contains the associated collection id.\n- `key`: This column contains the name of the attribute.\n- `kind`: This column contains the value type, which can be string, number, date, or range.\n- `rank`: This column contains the sort order.\n- `created_at`: This column contains the timestamp the attribute key was created.\n- `updated_at`: This column contains the timestamp the attribute key was updated.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide developers with an understanding of the structure and content of the `reservoir.attribute_keys` table. It also includes a link to query examples that can be used to retrieve data from the table.\n\nFor example, if a developer wants to retrieve all the attribute keys associated with a specific collection, they can use the following query:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM reservoir.attribute_keys\nWHERE collection_id = 'collection_id_value';\n```\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide is essential for developers who are working with the `reservoir.attribute_keys` table and need to understand its structure and contents.",
