  "summary": "# Collection Floor Ask Events\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the `reservoir.collection_floor_ask_events` table, which contains records with information about each collection floor ask change. The table has several columns, including `id`, `kind`, `collection_id`, `contract`, `token_id`, `order_id`, `maker`, `price`, `previous_price`, `valid_until`, `source`, `tx_hash`, `tx_timestamp`, and `created_at`. \n\nThe `kind` column specifies the type of event, which can be `new-order`, `expiry`, `sale`, `cancel`, `balance-change`, `approval-change`, `bootstrap`, `revalidation`, or `reprice`. The `collection_id` column contains the ID of the collection, while the `contract` column contains the address of the contract. The `token_id` column contains the ID of the token in the collection, and the `order_id` column contains the ID of the associated ask. The `maker` column contains the wallet address of the associated ask maker, and the `price` column contains the associated ask price in native currency. The `previous_price` column contains the previous floor ask price in native currency, and the `valid_until` column contains the expiration time of the associated ask. The `source` column specifies the source of the order, such as `opensea.io`. The `tx_hash` column contains the associated transaction hash, and the `tx_timestamp` column contains the associated transaction timestamp. The `created_at` column contains the timestamp when the event was recorded.\n\nThe guide also provides two query examples that can be used to retrieve information from the `reservoir.collection_floor_ask_events` table. The first query example can be found at [https://dune.com/queries/1302799/2232083](https://dune.com/queries/1302799/2232083), while the second query example can be found at [https://dune.com/queries/1302841/2232151](https://dune.com/queries/1302841/2232151).\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a detailed explanation of the `reservoir.collection_floor_ask_events` table and its columns, as well as query examples that can be used to retrieve information from the table.",
