  "summary": "# Dune Docs App Technical Guide: Attributes\n\n## Reservoir Attributes\n\nThis section of the guide covers the `reservoir.attributes` table, which contains records with information about each attribute. The table includes columns such as `id`, `value`, `token_count`, `on_sale_count`, `floor_sell_value`, `sell_updated_at`, `collection_id`, `kind`, `key`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. \n\nThe `id` column represents the internal attribute ID, while the `attribute_key_id` column represents the internal attribute key ID. The `value` column contains the attribute value, and the `token_count` column represents the amount of tokens that have the attribute. The `on_sale_count` column represents the amount of tokens that have the attribute and are on sale. The `floor_sell_value` column represents the current floor ask price, and the `sell_updated_at` column represents the timestamp the floor sale was last updated. The `collection_id` column represents the associated collection ID, and the `kind` column represents the value type (string, number, date, range). The `key` column represents the associated key name, and the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns represent the timestamps the attribute was created and updated, respectively.\n\nThis section also provides query examples that can be found at `https://dune.com/queries/1302927/2232298` and `https://dune.com/queries/1302966/2232361`.\n\nOverall, this section of the guide is useful for developers working on the Dune Docs app who need to understand the structure and contents of the `reservoir.attributes` table. It provides a clear overview of the table's columns and their meanings, as well as examples of queries that can be used to retrieve data from the table.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `reservoir.attributes` table in the context of blockchain? \n- The `reservoir.attributes` table contains information about each attribute, including the associated collection ID and the amount of tokens that have the attribute. \n\n2. How are the `floor_sell_value` and `sell_updated_at` columns relevant to blockchain analysis? \n- The `floor_sell_value` column contains the current floor ask price, which could be useful for analyzing token sales and market trends. The `sell_updated_at` column provides a timestamp for when the floor sale was last updated, which could also be relevant for market analysis. \n\n3. Are there any limitations or considerations to keep in mind when using the query examples provided in the technical guide? \n- The technical guide does not provide any information on limitations or considerations for the query examples, so it may be necessary to test and validate the queries before relying on them for analysis."
