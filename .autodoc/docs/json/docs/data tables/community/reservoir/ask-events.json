  "summary": "# Ask Events\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the `reservoir.ask_events` table, which contains records with information about each ask change. The table includes columns such as `id`, `kind`, `contract`, `token_id`, `order_id`, `maker`, `price`, `quantity_remaining`, `valid_from`, `valid_until`, `source`, `tx_hash`, `tx_timestamp`, and `created_at`. \n\nThe `id` column is an internal event ID, while the `kind` column specifies the type of event (e.g. new-order, expiry, sale, cancel, balance-change, approval-change, bootstrap, revalidation, reprice). The `contract` column contains the contract address, and the `token_id` column contains the ID of the token in the collection. The `order_id` column is the associated ask ID, and the `maker` column contains the associated ask maker wallet address. The `price` column contains the associated ask price in native currency, and the `quantity_remaining` column contains the associated ask tokens remaining. The `valid_from` and `valid_until` columns contain the associated ask validity start and expiration, respectively. The `source` column specifies the source of the order (e.g. opensea.io), while the `tx_hash` and `tx_timestamp` columns contain the associated transaction hash and timestamp, respectively. Finally, the `created_at` column contains the timestamp the event was recorded.\n\nThis section also includes links to query examples for the `reservoir.ask_events` table, which can be found at [https://dune.com/queries/1302858/2232178](https://dune.com/queries/1302858/2232178) and [https://dune.com/queries/1302863/2232189](https://dune.com/queries/1302863/2232189).\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a detailed overview of the `reservoir.ask_events` table and its various columns, as well as links to query examples for further exploration. It is relevant to the data tables section of the project app.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `reservoir.ask_events` table in the context of blockchain and SQL analysis?\n- The `reservoir.ask_events` table contains records with information about each ask change, which could be useful for analyzing the behavior of buyers and sellers in a blockchain marketplace.\n\n2. Are there any limitations or constraints on the data that can be queried from this table?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on any limitations or constraints on the data that can be queried from this table.\n\n3.
