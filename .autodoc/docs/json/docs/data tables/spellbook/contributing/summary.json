The guide provides an example of the folder structure for the Keep3r network, where the folder is `/spellbook/models/keep3r_network/ethereum`. \n\nThe guide explains that if the project folder exists but a Spell is being created for a new blockchain, a folder for the new blockchain should be created. The guide then explains that three files need to be created: a `.sql` file for the Spell's logic, a `_schema.yml` file to define the Spell's purpose and add generic tests, descriptions, metadata, etc., and a `_sources.yml` file with any project-specific table dependencies. The guide provides an example of the file structure for a Spell folder. \n\nThe guide also explains the naming convention for Spell files. Schema files are named `[project_name]_[blockchain]_schema.yml`, sources files are named `[project_name]_[blockchain]_sources.yml`, and SQL files for Spells are named `[project_name]_[blockchain]_[spell_name].sql`. \n\nThe guide then provides an example of a specific v1 migration example where three additional `.sql` files are needed for a Spell called `keep3r_network_ethereum_view_job_log.sql`. The guide explains that these files are needed because the original `view_job_log.sql` V1 Abstraction has two `FROM` statements that reference two other files that are also abstractions that need to be converted into Spells. The guide also explains that a recursive check needs to be done to see if those abstractions depend on any other abstractions that have yet to be migrated to Spells. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to set up the file structure for Spells in the Dune Docs project.

The table is materialized as an incrementally loaded table updated every 15 minutes because the next step includes a slower `window` function to capture a rolling sum.\n\nThe guide explains the novel components that make this Spell incremental. The `<div data-gb-custom-block data-tag=\"if\"> </div>` JINJA block allows the addition of an arbitrary filter when running in “incremental” mode. Incremental mode is default, and a full refresh is denoted by a command-line argument to completely recreate the table. The block is used to filter for all data timestamped in the last two days. The model runs every fifteen minutes, but a look back of 2 days is allowed to account for data arriving late from the blockchain.\n\nThe guide also explains the use of “refs” in this spellset. A ref, like `{{ ref('tokens_ethereum_erc20') }}` is a reference to another model in the DBT project. The ref references the name of the file itself. That means, duplicate file names are not allowed.\n\nThe guide provides an example of the `transfers_ethereum_erc20_agg_day.sql` file, which contains the SQL code for the Daily Aggregation feature. The file uses the `config` function to set the alias, materialized, file format, incremental strategy, and unique key. The SQL code selects the blockchain, date truncated to the day, wallet address, token address, symbol, sum of the amount_raw, sum of the amount_raw divided by power(10, t.decimals), and unique_transfer_id. The file also uses the `left join` function to join the `transfers_ethereum_erc20` and `tokens_ethereum_erc20` tables. The `where` function is used to filter the data timestamped in the last two days. The `group by` function is used to group the data by date truncated to the day, wallet address, token address, t.symbol, and unique_tx_id.\n\nThe guide also provides an example of the `transfers_ethereum_schema.yml` file, which contains the schema for the Daily Aggregation feature. The file includes the name, meta, config, and columns of the table. The columns include blockchain, hour, wallet_address, token_address, symbol, amount_raw, amount, and amount_usd.\n\nIn summary, the Daily Aggregation feature of the Dune Docs project is an incrementally loaded table updated every 15 minutes that sums all transfers for the day. The feature uses a JINJA block to add an arbitrary filter when running in “incremental” mode and refs to reference another model in the DBT project. The `transfers_ethereum_erc20_agg_day.sql` file contains the SQL code for the feature, while the `transfers_ethereum_schema.yml` file contains the schema for the feature.",

The spell is expanded to cover all days, not just the days with transfer activity. The guide also explains how price data is added, known rebase tokens are removed, and any tokens that resulted in large negative balances are removed.\n\nThe `balances_ethereum_erc20_day.sql` file contains the SQL code for the spell. The code uses the `transfers_ethereum_erc20_rolling_day` table to derive the `balances_ethereum_erc20_noncompliant` table. The `balances_ethereum_erc20_noncompliant` table looks for unique token addresses with larger negative balances, which indicate the contract may not be compliant with ERC20. The `tokens_ethereum_rebase` table is a static list of known rebase tokens that are managed.\n\nThe SQL code in `balances_ethereum_erc20_day.sql` calculates the daily token balances of ERC20 Ethereum tokens per wallet and contract address pair. The code uses the `prices` table to calculate the amount in USD. The code also removes rebase tokens from balances and likely non-compliant tokens due to negative balances.\n\nThe `transfers_ethereum_schema.yml` file contains the schema for the `balances_ethereum_erc20_day` table. The table has columns for the blockchain, day, wallet address, token address, amount raw, amount, amount USD, and symbol.\n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a detailed explanation of the final daily Ethereum ERC20 token balances spell and how it works.
