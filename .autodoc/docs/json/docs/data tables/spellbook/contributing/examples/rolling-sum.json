  "summary": "# Rolling Sum of Daily Transfers\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the rolling sum of daily transfers feature of the Dune Docs project. The purpose of this feature is to apply a rolling sum window function to each daily transfer sum. The query for this feature is provided in the `transfers_ethereum_erc20_rolling_day.sql` file. The query selects the blockchain, day, wallet address, token address, symbol, last updated timestamp, recency index, and the sum of the raw amount and amount of the ERC20 token held. \n\nThe `transfers_ethereum_schema.yml` file contains the schema for the `transfers_ethereum_erc20_rolling_hour` table. This table includes columns for the blockchain, hour, wallet address, token address, symbol, amount raw, amount, amount in USD, updated at timestamp, and recency index. \n\nThe purpose of these files is to provide the necessary code and schema for the rolling sum of daily transfers feature. The `transfers_ethereum_erc20_rolling_day.sql` file provides the query for the feature, while the `transfers_ethereum_schema.yml` file provides the schema for the table that stores the results of the query. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides developers with the necessary information to implement the rolling sum of daily transfers feature in the Dune Docs project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Rolling Sum of Daily Transfers query in the context of blockchain SQL analysis?\n- The Rolling Sum of Daily Transfers query is used to apply a rolling sum window function to each daily transfer sum in order to calculate the amount of ERC20 tokens held by each wallet/contract pair.\n\n2. How does the Rolling Sum of Daily Transfers query handle missing data?\n- The Rolling Sum of Daily Transfers query fills in all the missing days and does a few more clean up steps in order to ensure accurate calculations.\n\n3. What information is included in the transfers_ethereum_erc20_rolling_hour schema?\n- The transfers_ethereum_erc20_rolling_hour schema includes information such as the blockchain, hour, wallet address, token address, ERC20 token symbol, rolling sum of raw amount of ERC20 token held, rolling sum of amount of ERC20 token held in USD, UTC timestamp when table was last updated, and recency index."
