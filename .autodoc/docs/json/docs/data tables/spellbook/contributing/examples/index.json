  "summary": "This app technical guide covers the Spellbook Examples for the Dune Docs project. The Spellbook Examples are a series of modular spells that demonstrate how to track daily balances for ERC-20 tokens that follow a contract standard set by the Ethereum Foundation. The guide begins by introducing ERC-20 tokens and the need to identify transfers to track daily balances. The main base Dune table used for this purpose is `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer`, which can be found via the data explorer.\n\nThe guide then goes on to describe the modular spells that make up the Spellbook Examples. The first spell is the Reformatted transfers spell, which reformats the data from the `evt_Transfer` table to make it easier to work with. The second spell is the Daily aggregation of transfers spell, which aggregates the transfers on a daily basis. The third spell is the Rolling sum of daily transfers spell, which calculates the rolling sum of daily transfers. The final spell is the Final daily balances for Ethereum ERC20 tokens spell, which calculates the final daily balances for the ERC-20 tokens.\n\nEach spell is described in detail, with examples and screenshots where appropriate. The guide is focused on the app folder of the project and provides a high-level overview of the purpose of each spell and how it applies to the app. Overall, this guide serves as a useful resource for developers looking to track daily balances for ERC-20 tokens using the Dune Docs app.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Dune table `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer` and how does it relate to blockchain data analysis? \n   - The Dune table `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer` is used to track daily balances of ERC-20 tokens and is a key component in analyzing blockchain data related to token transfers.\n2. How does the Spellbook Examples module break down the analysis of ERC-20 tokens? \n   - The Spellbook Examples module breaks down the analysis of ERC-20 tokens into a series of modular spells, including reformatted transfers, daily aggregation, rolling sum, and final daily balances.\n3. Is this app technical guide specific to Ethereum or can it be applied to other blockchain platforms? \n   - The app technical guide specifically references ERC-20 tokens and the Ethereum Foundation, so a blockchain SQL analyst may wonder if the techniques and tools described can be applied to other blockchain platforms and token standards."
