  "summary": "This technical guide is focused on the app feature of the Dune Docs project. The guide provides a step-by-step process for writing a Spell as a SELECT statement. The guide starts by explaining that the endpoint is `_view_job_log.sql`, but the lowest-level dependency is `_view_job_migrations.sql`. The guide then explains that the process of migrating from V1 abstraction to V2 Spell starts by copying the contents of the V1 file to the `keep3r_network_ethereum_view_job_migrations.sql` file. The guide then explains how to modify the syntax from V1 abstraction style to V2 Spell style. \n\nThe guide also explains how to replace hard-coded references with JINJA templating. The guide clarifies that sources are data that have been added by the Dune team, while models are the `SELECT` statements defined in the `.sql` files stored inside the `spellbook/models` directory. The guide provides examples of how to format references to sources and models using JINJA templating. \n\nThe guide emphasizes the importance of testing each SQL file individually and fixing any errors before adding JINJA templating. The guide also provides tips on how to fix errors, including googling the error message or asking for help in the community Discord channel. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a detailed explanation of how to write a Spell as a SELECT statement and how to replace hard-coded references with JINJA templating. The guide is well-organized and easy to follow, making it a useful resource for developers working on the Dune Docs app.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the dune docs app?\n- The app technical guide does not provide information on the purpose of the dune docs app.\n\n2. What programming languages or technologies are used in this app?\n- The app technical guide mentions the use of SQL, PostgreSQL, Spark SQL, and JINJA templating.\n\n3. What is the process for migrating from V1 abstraction to V2 Spell style?\n- The app technical guide provides a detailed process for migrating from V1 abstraction to V2 Spell style, which involves modifying the syntax to Spark SQL, replacing hard-coded references with JINJA templating, and testing the SQL code in dune.com."
