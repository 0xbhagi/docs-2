  "summary": "This app technical guide covers the process of deciding on a Spell to cast in the Dune app. The guide provides three ways to decide on a Spell, including having an idea of what abstract data is needed, looking at Spellbook bounties in Dework, or asking for suggestions in the #spellbook Discord channel. The guide then provides an example of creating a migration Spell for translating the Keep3r network view_job_log abstraction from Dune's v1 database into a V2 Spell.\n\nThe guide also includes a note that Dune V1 Abstractions have been moved to a new repository, which needs to be cloned to access the code for migrating a V1 Abstraction to a Spell. The guide provides the full path to the view_job_log.sql file, which is needed to set up the file structure for the Spell's SQL schema and source files.\n\nOverall, this guide provides a step-by-step process for deciding on a Spell to cast and creating a migration Spell in the Dune app. It also includes helpful links and examples to guide users through the process.",
