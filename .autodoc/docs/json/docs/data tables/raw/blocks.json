  "summary": "# Blocks\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the concept of blocks in blockchains and rollups. A block is a collection of transactions that incrementally alter the state of an EVM system. Transactions within a block can only be executed one after the other, not in parallel. \n\nThe guide provides tables that are useful for identifying block activity and transaction changes over time. These tables are divided into two sections: V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PosgreSQL). Each table contains information about different chains, such as Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Avalanche C-Chain. The tables also provide notes on what information is not included in each chain. \n\nThe guide also includes a section on column data, which provides a description of each column in the tables. The columns include `time`, `number`, `hash`, `parent hash`, `gas_limit`, `gas_used`, `miner`, `difficulty`, `total_difficulty`, `nonce`, `size`, and `base_fee_per_gas`. Each column has a data type and a description of what it represents. \n\nThe guide provides an example of the column data in the form of a video. The video shows how to use the tables to identify block activity and transaction changes over time. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of blocks in blockchains and rollups. It also provides useful tables and column data that can be used to analyze block activity and transaction changes over time.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Dune Docs app in relation to blockchain SQL analysis?\n- The app technical guide provides information on tables and column data that can be used for identifying block activity and transaction changes over time in various chains.\n\n2. What is the difference between the V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PosgreSQL) tables?\n- The V2 Engine tables contain more chains and additional columns such as `miner`, `nonce`, and `base_fee_per_gas`, while the V1 Engine tables have fewer chains and do not contain `nonce` or `base_fee_per_gas`.\n\n3. How can the Dune Docs app be used to analyze blockchains and rollups?\n- The app provides tables and column data that can be queried using Spark SQL or PostgreSQL to analyze block activity and transaction changes over time in various chains."
