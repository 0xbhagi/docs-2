  "summary": "# Blocks\n\nThis section of the app technical guide focuses on the `Solana.blocks` table, which contains block data within Solana's blockchain. The purpose of this table is to identify block activity and transaction changes over time. The table includes several columns such as `hash`, `height`, `slot`, `time`, `date`, `parent_slot`, `previous_block___hash`, `total_transactions`, `successful_transactions`, and `failed_transactions`. Each column is described in detail, including the data type and a brief explanation of what it represents.\n\nFor example, the `hash` column is a string that represents the hash of the block, base-58 encoded. The `height` column is a bigint that represents the number of blocks beneath this block. The `time` column is a timestamp that represents the estimated time this block was produced. The `total_transactions` column is a bigint that represents the total number of transactions in this block, while the `successful_transactions` and `failed_transactions` columns represent the number of successful and failed transactions in this block, respectively.\n\nThe guide also includes a video that provides an overview of the `Solana.blocks` table. Additionally, there are two Solana Query examples provided: `Solana blocks over time` and `Transactions per day`. These examples demonstrate how to use the `Solana.blocks` table to analyze block activity and transaction changes over time.\n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `Solana.blocks` table and its columns. It also includes examples of how to use the table to analyze block activity and transaction changes over time.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Solana.blocks table in the Dune Docs app?\n- The Solana.blocks table contains block data within Solana's blockchain and can be used to identify block activity and transaction changes over time.\n\n2. What data types are used in the Solana.blocks table?\n- The Solana.blocks table uses data types such as string, bigint, timestamp, and date.\n\n3. Are there any sample queries available for analyzing Solana.blocks data in the Dune Docs app?\n- Yes, there are sample queries available for analyzing Solana.blocks data in the Dune Docs app, such as Solana blocks over time and Transactions per day."
