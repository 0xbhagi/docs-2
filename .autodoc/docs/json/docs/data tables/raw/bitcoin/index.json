  "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Bitcoin\n\nThis guide provides information on how to work with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. As a non-EVM chain, Bitcoin's raw data looks different from other chains, and this guide aims to help users understand and work with this data.\n\nThe guide starts with a brief introduction to Bitcoin and provides a link to a full written guide on getting started. This is useful for users who are new to Bitcoin and want to learn more about it.\n\nThe main section of the guide is \"Data Available,\" which lists the different types of Bitcoin data that are available in the Dune Docs project. These include blocks, transactions, outputs, and inputs. Each of these data types has its own page, which provides more detailed information on how to work with that specific type of data.\n\nFor example, the \"Blocks\" page provides information on how to access and analyze Bitcoin block data, while the \"Transactions\" page provides information on how to work with Bitcoin transaction data. The \"Outputs\" and \"Inputs\" pages provide information on how to work with Bitcoin output and input data, respectively.\n\nOverall, this guide is a useful resource for anyone who wants to work with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. It provides an overview of the different types of data available and links to more detailed information on each type.",
