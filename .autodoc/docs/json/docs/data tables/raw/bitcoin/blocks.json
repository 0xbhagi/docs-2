It provides a detailed description of the columns in the `bitcoin.blocks` table, which contains information about each block in the Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nEach column name is listed along with its corresponding data type and a description of what the column represents. For example, the `time` column represents the time at which the block was mined, while the `height` column represents the block number. \n\nThe guide also includes information about the various rewards associated with mining a block, such as the `mint_reward` and `total_reward`. Additionally, it provides details about the size of the block, the number of transactions it contains, and the difficulty of mining the block. \n\nOverall, this section of the guide is useful for developers who are working with Bitcoin data and need to understand the structure of the `bitcoin.blocks` table. \n\nExample: If a developer wants to retrieve information about the size of a particular block, they can query the `size` column in the `bitcoin.blocks` table.",
