  "summary": "The Transactions section of the Dune Docs project provides a detailed guide on the `bitcoin.transactions` feature. This guide covers the various columns that make up the transaction table, including their data types and descriptions. The table columns include block time, block date, block height, block hash, index, ID, input value, output value, fee, input count, output count, size, virtual size, is coinbase, coinbase, input, output, lock time, and hex. \n\nThe guide also provides definitions for the various structures within the input and output columns. The input structure includes fields such as value, height, tx_id, output_number, coinbase, sequence, witness_data, script_signature, and script_pub_key. The output structure includes fields such as index, value, and script_pub_key. \n\nThe guide explains that the STRUCT data type allows for representing nested hierarchical data and has key-value pairs. It is similar to a dictionary in Python and can be used to group fields together to make them more accessible. The guide also provides examples of how to work with these columns using syntax such as `input[1].witness_data[2]` or `input[3].script_pub_key.address`. \n\nOverall, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `bitcoin.transactions` feature, including the various columns and structures that make up the transaction table. It is a valuable resource for developers working with this feature in the Dune Docs project.",
