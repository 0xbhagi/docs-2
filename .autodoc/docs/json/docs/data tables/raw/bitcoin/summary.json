      "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Bitcoin\n\nThis guide provides information on how to work with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. As a non-EVM chain, Bitcoin's raw data looks different from other chains, and this guide aims to help users understand and work with this data.\n\nThe guide starts with a brief introduction to Bitcoin and provides a link to a full written guide on getting started. This is useful for users who are new to Bitcoin and want to learn more about it.\n\nThe main section of the guide is \"Data Available,\" which lists the different types of Bitcoin data that are available in the Dune Docs project. These include blocks, transactions, outputs, and inputs. Each of these data types has its own page, which provides more detailed information on how to work with that specific type of data.\n\nFor example, the \"Blocks\" page provides information on how to access and analyze Bitcoin block data, while the \"Transactions\" page provides information on how to work with Bitcoin transaction data. The \"Outputs\" and \"Inputs\" pages provide information on how to work with Bitcoin output and input data, respectively.\n\nOverall, this guide is a useful resource for anyone who wants to work with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. It provides an overview of the different types of data available and links to more detailed information on each type.",
      "questions": "1. What type of data is available for analysis in this app?\n- The app provides data on blocks, transactions, outputs, and inputs for Bitcoin.\n\n2. Is this app compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains?\n- No, this app is specifically designed for non-EVM chains like Bitcoin.\n\n3. Are there any additional resources available for getting started with analyzing Bitcoin data?\n- Yes, the app provides a link to a full written guide on getting started with analyzing Bitcoin data."

      "summary": "The Inputs section of the app technical guide for the Dune Docs project provides a detailed description of the `bitcoin.inputs` table. This table contains information related to the inputs of Bitcoin transactions, including block time, block date, block height, index, transaction ID, spent block height, spent transaction ID, spent output number, value, address, type, coinbase, script ASM, script HEX, script description, script signature ASM, script signature HEX, sequence, and witness data. \n\nThe guide provides a table that lists each column name, data type, and a brief description of what the column represents. For example, the `block_time` column represents the time at which the block containing the input was mined, while the `value` column represents the number of Satoshis attached to the input. \n\nThe guide also provides additional information about certain columns, such as the `sequence` column, which is intended to allow unconfirmed time-locked transactions to be updated before being finalized. The guide notes that this column is not currently used except to disable locktime in a transaction. \n\nOverall, this section of the app technical guide provides developers with a comprehensive understanding of the `bitcoin.inputs` table and the information it contains. By providing detailed descriptions of each column, developers can more easily work with this data and integrate it into their applications.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app is not clearly described in this technical guide, so a blockchain SQL analyst might want to know more about its intended use and how it interacts with blockchain data.\n\n2. Are there any limitations or known issues with the data being collected in the `bitcoin.inputs` table?\n- The technical guide does not provide information on data quality or potential issues with the input data, so an analyst might want to investigate this further before using the data for analysis.\n\n3. Is there any additional documentation or support available for using this app and its associated data tables?\n- The technical guide only provides information on the `bitcoin.inputs` table, so an analyst might want to know if there are other tables or resources available for understanding the app and its data."
