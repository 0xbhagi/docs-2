  "summary": "# Traces\n\nThis technical guide covers the Traces feature of the Dune Docs project. Traces tables contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions. Transactions can trigger smaller atomic actions that modify the internal state of an Ethereum Virtual Machine. Information about the execution of these actions is logged and can be found stored as an EVM execution trace, or just a trace. \n\nThe guide provides information on the tables and column data of the Traces feature. The tables are divided into two engines: V2 Engine (Spark SQL) and V1 Engine (PosgreSQL). Each table contains information about the traces of different chains, such as Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Avalanche C-Chain. The column data provides a detailed description of each column in the tables. \n\nThe guide also explains the gas used in `.traces`. The `gas_used` column in the `.traces` tables is a bit hard to understand, so the guide provides pointers on how to understand it. For example, the `gas_used` of a trace will always include the gas consumed by the trace and all its subtraces. \n\nFinally, the guide provides information on creation traces. One type of trace, `create`, is used to create a smart contract then transfer ether to it. The guide provides tables and column data for creation traces. \n\nOverall, this technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Traces feature of the Dune Docs project. \n\nExample queries are also provided in the guide. For instance, there is an example query that shows how to arrive at the \"true\" `gas_used` value. Another example query shows how to create a smart contract then transfer ether to it. \n\nNote that this guide is not a part of the Dune Docs project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `traces` tables in the different chains listed in the guide?\n- The `traces` tables contain information about the execution of smaller atomic actions generated by transactions in different chains.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `gas` and `gas_used` columns in the `.traces` tables?\n- The `gas` column represents the gas provided with the message call, while the `gas_used` column represents the gas consumed by the transaction in `wei`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `creation_traces` tables in the different chains listed in the guide?\n- The `creation_traces` tables contain information about the creation of smart contracts and the transfer of ether to them."
