  "summary": "# Bids\n\n## Reservoir.bids\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the `reservoir.bids` table, which contains records with information about each bid. The table includes various columns such as `id`, `kind`, `status`, `contract`, `token_set_id`, `maker`, `taker`, `price`, `value`, `currency_address`, `currency_symbol`, `currency_price`, `quantity`, `quantity_filled`, `quantity_remaining`, `valid_from`, `valid_until`, `nonce`, `source`, `fee_bps`, `expiration`, `raw_data`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.\n\nThe `id` column represents the internal order id, while the `kind` column represents the protocol name (e.g. seaport). The `status` column represents the order status (active, inactive), and the `contract` column represents the contract address. The `token_set_id` column represents the id of the token set, while the `maker` and `taker` columns represent the maker and taker wallet addresses, respectively.\n\nThe `price` column represents the current price in native currency, while the `value` column represents the current value in native currency. The `currency_address` column represents the currency address, and the `currency_symbol` column represents the currency symbol. The `currency_price` column represents the currency price.\n\nThe `quantity` column represents the amount of tokens that is listed, while the `quantity_filled` column represents the amount of tokens that was filled. The `quantity_remaining` column represents the amount of tokens remaining, and the `valid_from` and `valid_until` columns represent the listing start and end times, respectively.\n\nThe `nonce` column represents the order nonce of the maker, while the `source` column represents the source of the listing (e.g. opensea.io). The `fee_bps` column represents the listing fee, and the `expiration` column represents the associated transaction hash. The `raw_data` column represents the raw order data (format will vary per source).\n\nFinally, the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns represent the timestamps the listing was created and updated, respectively.\n\nQuery examples for this table can be found at the link provided in the guide.",
