  "summary": "# Sandwiches Table\n\nThe `sandwiches` table is a part of the Dune Docs project and contains detailed information about executed sandwiches. The table consists of the following columns:\n\n- `created_at`: This column contains the time of the record's creation.\n- `block_number`: This column contains the block number.\n- `backrun_swap_trace_address`: This column contains the address of the swap in the backrun transaction.\n- `backrun_swap_transaction_hash`: This column contains the transaction hash of the backrun transaction of the specified sandwich.\n- `frontrun_swap_trace_address`: This column contains the address of the swap in the frontrun transaction.\n- `frontrun_swap_transaction_hash`: This column contains the transaction hash of the frontrun transaction of the specified sandwich.\n- `id`: This column contains the internal id of the sandwich.\n- `profit_amount`: This column contains the profit amount after the arbitrage.\n- `profit_token_address`: This column contains the address of the profit asset.\n- `sandwicher_address`: This column contains the address of the sandwicher.\n- `timestamp`: This column contains the timestamp of the latest update of the file.\n\nThe `sandwiches` table is used to keep track of executed sandwiches and their details. For example, it can be used to analyze the performance of the sandwicher and the profitability of the arbitrage. \n\nHere is an example of how the `sandwiches` table can be queried:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM sandwiches\nWHERE sandwicher_address = '0x1234567890abcdef'\n```\n\nThis query will return all the sandwiches executed by the sandwicher with the address `0x1234567890abcdef`.",
