  "summary": "# Flashbots\n\nThis section of the app technical guide covers the Flashbots project, a research and development organization focused on ensuring that MEV (Miner Extractable Value) incentives do not become opaque and undemocratic. MEV refers to the profit that miners can extract from reordering, censoring, or including transactions in a block. \n\nThe guide notes that Flashbots' open source engine for generating MEV data, mev-inspect-py, powers dashboards such as mev-explore and Dune's Flashbots integration. The section encourages researchers and developers to report any bugs or implement new features to improve the engine. \n\nThe guide provides links to the Flashbots documentation and Discord server for more information and updates on their data and mev-inspect. \n\nExample: If a developer is working on integrating Flashbots into their project, they can refer to the documentation and join the Discord server to stay up-to-date on any changes or improvements to the engine. They can also report any bugs they encounter to help improve the engine for the community.",
