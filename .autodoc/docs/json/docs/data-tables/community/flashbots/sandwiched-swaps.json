  "summary": "# Sandwiched Swaps\n\nThe Sandwiched Swaps section of the Dune Docs project focuses on the `flashbots.sandwiched_swaps` table, which contains additional data about one or more swaps that were sandwiched with a corresponding sandwich in the database. This section provides a detailed explanation of the columns in the table and their respective data types.\n\nThe `created_at` column contains the time of the record's creation, while the `block_number` column contains the block number of the transaction. The `sandwich_id` column contains the internal ID of the sandwiched swap, and the `trace_address` column contains the trace pattern related to the position of the swap in the chain of all swaps related to the arbitrage trade. Finally, the `transaction_hash` column contains the transaction hash, and the `timestamp` column contains the timestamp of the latest update of the file.\n\nThis section also provides query examples for the `flashbots.sandwiched_swaps` table, which can be used as a reference for developers working on the Dune Docs project. The query examples include the column name, data type, and description of each column in the table.\n\nOverall, the Sandwiched Swaps section of the Dune Docs project provides a comprehensive guide to the `flashbots.sandwiched_swaps` table, including its purpose, columns, and query examples. This information is essential for developers working on the Dune Docs project to understand the structure and functionality of the table and to use it effectively in their work.",
