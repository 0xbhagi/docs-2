  "summary": "# Transactions\n\nThe Transactions section of the Dune Docs project provides a technical guide for the Solana.transactions table, which contains transaction data within Solana's blockchain. The table includes relevant data related to account, protocol, and program activity. The guide provides a detailed description of each column in the table, including the column name, column type, and description. \n\nThe guide also includes query examples that demonstrate how to extract data from the table. For example, the guide provides a query that shows NFT transactions of popular programs in the past seven days and an overview of the drift-protocol. \n\nThe guide also includes definitions for several data types used in the table, including STRUCT, which allows for representing nested hierarchical data and has key-value pairs. The guide provides examples of how to use these data types to extract data from the table. \n\nThe guide also includes definitions for several struct types used in the table, including token_balance, instructions, inner_instructions, and error. Each struct type includes a field, data type, and description. \n\nOverall, the Transactions section of the Dune Docs project provides a comprehensive technical guide for the Solana.transactions table, including detailed descriptions of each column and struct type, as well as query examples that demonstrate how to extract data from the table.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the Solana.transactions table?\n   \n   The Solana.transactions table contains transaction data within Solana's blockchain, including relevant data related to account, protocol, and program activity.\n\n2. What is the data type of the token_balance field in the Struct definitions?\n   \n   The data type of the token_balance field in the Struct definitions is Decimal.\n\n3. How can the STRUCT data type be used to group fields together?\n   \n   The STRUCT data type can be used to group fields together to make them more accessible, similar to a dictionary in Python."
