For example, the `time` column represents the block time, while the `height` column represents the block number. \n\nThis information is useful for developers who are working with Bitcoin blocks and need to access specific details about them. For example, a developer building a Bitcoin wallet app might use this feature to display information about recent Bitcoin blocks to their users. \n\nOverall, the Blocks section of the app technical guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `bitcoin.blocks` feature, making it easier for developers to understand and use this feature in their projects.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `bitcoin.blocks` table in this app? \n- The `bitcoin.blocks` table contains information about individual blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, including their height, hash, transaction count, and various other metrics.\n\n2. How is the `total_reward` column calculated? \n- The `total_reward` column represents the static reward given to the miner and is calculated as the sum of the outputs in the coinbase transaction (the first transaction).\n\n3. What is the significance of the `difficulty` column? \n- The `difficulty` column represents the estimated amount of work done to find this block relative to the estimated amount of work done to find block 0. It is a measure of the level of difficulty in mining the block and is used to adjust the mining difficulty level of the network."

      "summary": "# App Technical Guide: Bitcoin\n\nThis guide provides information on how to work with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. Bitcoin is a non-EVM chain, and its raw data looks different from other chains. The guide covers the available data and how to access it.\n\n## Data Available\n\nThis section lists the types of Bitcoin data available in the Dune Docs project. The data is organized into four categories:\n\n- Blocks: This page provides information on Bitcoin blocks, including their height, hash, and timestamp. It also includes data on the number of transactions and the total fees.\n- Transactions: This page provides information on Bitcoin transactions, including their hash, size, and fee. It also includes data on the number of inputs and outputs.\n- Outputs: This page provides information on Bitcoin outputs, including their value and script.\n- Inputs: This page provides information on Bitcoin inputs, including their previous output and script.\n\nEach page provides detailed information on the data available, as well as examples of how to query the data using the Dune Analytics platform.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nThis guide also includes a link to a full written guide on getting started with Bitcoin data analysis. The guide provides additional information on how to analyze Bitcoin data using the Dune Analytics platform.\n\nOverall, this guide is a useful resource for anyone looking to work with Bitcoin data in the Dune Docs project. It provides a clear overview of the available data and how to access it, as well as additional resources for further learning.",
      "questions": "1. What kind of data is available for analysis in this app?\n- The app technical guide lists blocks, transactions, outputs, and inputs as available data for analysis.\n\n2. Is this app specifically designed for analyzing Bitcoin data or can it be used for other blockchain data as well?\n- The title and description of the app technical guide suggest that it is specifically designed for analyzing Bitcoin data.\n\n3. Are there any specific tools or programming languages required to use this app?\n- The app technical guide does not mention any specific tools or programming languages required to use this app."

      "summary": "# Inputs\n\nThe `Inputs` section of the app technical guide covers the `bitcoin.inputs` feature of the project. This feature provides a table with detailed information about the inputs of a Bitcoin transaction. The table includes columns such as `block_time`, `block_date`, `block_height`, `index`, `tx_id`, `spent_block_height`, `spent_tx_id`, `spent_output_number`, `value`, `address`, `type`, `coinbase`, `is_coinbase`, `script_asm`, `script_hex`, `script_desc`, `script_signature_asm`, `script_signature_hex`, `sequence`, and `witness_data`.\n\nEach column is described in detail, including its data type and a brief explanation of its purpose. For example, the `block_time` column contains a timestamp of when the block was mined, while the `value` column contains the number of Satoshis attached to the input. The `address` column contains the address that owned or owns the output used as input, and the `type` column contains the address type of the input.\n\nThe `Inputs` section is useful for developers who need to access detailed information about Bitcoin transactions. For example, a developer building a Bitcoin wallet app might use this feature to display transaction details to the user. \n\nExample usage:\n```python\nimport dune_docs\n\ninputs_table = dune_docs.bitcoin.inputs\nprint(inputs_table.head())\n```\nThis code imports the `dune_docs` module and accesses the `bitcoin.inputs` feature. It then prints the first few rows of the table using the `head()` method.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this app and how does it relate to blockchain technology?\n- The app is not explicitly stated in the provided technical guide, so a blockchain SQL analyst might need more information on the context and use case of the app to understand its relevance to blockchain technology.\n\n2. How is the data in the `bitcoin.inputs` table sourced and updated?\n- The technical guide does not provide information on the data source or update frequency of the `bitcoin.inputs` table, which could be important for a blockchain SQL analyst to understand the reliability and timeliness of the data.\n\n3. Are there any limitations or known issues with the app's handling of bitcoin input data?\n- The technical guide does not mention any potential issues or limitations with the app's handling of bitcoin input data, but a blockchain SQL analyst might want to know if there are any known bugs or edge cases that could affect the accuracy or completeness of the data."

This table contains information about the outputs of Bitcoin transactions, including the block time, block date, block height, block hash, transaction ID, output index, value, script ASM, script hex, address, and address type. \n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide developers with a clear understanding of the data contained in the `bitcoin.outputs` table and how it can be used in the Dune Docs app. For example, developers can use this table to track the movement of Bitcoin between addresses, analyze transaction patterns, and identify potential fraud or money laundering activities.\n\nEach column in the table is described in detail, including the data type, description, and any relevant examples. For instance, the `value` column contains the number of Satoshis attached to each output, which can be used to calculate the total value of a transaction. The `address` column contains the address that owns each output, which can be used to track the movement of Bitcoin between addresses.\n\nOverall, the Outputs section of the app technical guide provides developers with a comprehensive overview of the `bitcoin.outputs` table and its role in the Dune Docs app. By understanding the data contained in this table, developers can build more powerful and effective tools for analyzing Bitcoin transactions.",
