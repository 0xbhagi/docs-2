  "summary": "The Outputs section of the app technical guide for the Dune Docs project provides a detailed description of the `bitcoin.outputs` table. This table contains information about the outputs of Bitcoin transactions, including the block time, block date, block height, block hash, transaction ID, output index, value, script ASM, script hex, address, and address type. \n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide developers with a clear understanding of the data contained in the `bitcoin.outputs` table and how it can be used in the Dune Docs app. For example, developers can use this table to track the movement of Bitcoin between addresses, analyze transaction patterns, and identify potential fraud or money laundering activities.\n\nEach column in the table is described in detail, including the data type, description, and any relevant examples. For instance, the `value` column contains the number of Satoshis attached to each output, which can be used to calculate the total value of a transaction. The `address` column contains the address that owns each output, which can be used to track the movement of Bitcoin between addresses.\n\nOverall, the Outputs section of the app technical guide provides developers with a comprehensive overview of the `bitcoin.outputs` table and its role in the Dune Docs app. By understanding the data contained in this table, developers can build more powerful and effective tools for analyzing Bitcoin transactions.",
