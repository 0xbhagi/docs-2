Block explorers are one of the most important tools for any Data Analyst/Scientist. In a nutshell, they allow you to well, explore the blockchain!

They provide an online interface for you to look up any particular blockchain of choice, and retrieve data about transactions, addresses, blocks, and fees, amongst others. 

Here, you'll find the primary web-based explorers for the most popular blockchains.
