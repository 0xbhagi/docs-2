**Project Dashboards allow you to easily assemble data on your favorite project in one place.**

Without having to maintain infrastructure or overhead, you can simply query for the data you desire and assemble it on a Dashboard to make a Datahub for your project Reality.

Let's explore this with an example:

## [Tornado.Cash](https://dune.com/poma/tornado-cash\_1) by [@poma](https://dune.com/poma)

This is the Dashboard shows us many important metrics for one protocol, Tornado Cash, all in one place.

We can see that @poma wanted to show us a few "at a glance" counters which make important data like total deposits and unique users easy to view and understand by just about anyone.

@poma follows this up with some interesting historical data points which show the growth in users and volume. The Dashboard continues, but you can clearly already see how much value these stats and charts can produce for a company, protocol, or community.

You can find many other great Dashboards on the [Dune Projects Page](https://dune.com/projects).
