## Autocomplete

You can enable/disable the autocomplete function of the Query editor using the gear wheel in the top right corner:

The autocomplete feature will bring up PostgreSQL keywords, as well as tables and aliases you've already included in your Query.

## Run Selection

To save yourself time while testing and debugging your Queries, you can run just a part of your Query.

To do this, highlight a part of your Query. You'll then see the <span class="fk-btn-1">Run</span> button turn into a <span class="fk-btn-1">Run selection</span> button.

Click and ðŸª„

You'll need to highlight a syntactically complete and correct piece of SQL otherwise you'll get an error:
