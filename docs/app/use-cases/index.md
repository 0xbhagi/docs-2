## Dune is an open platform

Dune is a blockchain data analytics platform that serves a few different groups:

- **Dune Spectators** can view a variety of on-chain data made interesting and understandable via Dashboards on Dune.com.

- **Dune Wizards** are the magicians who take the raw data the Dune Platform ingests and use it to tell stories via [Dashboards](../../getting-started/dashboards.md), [Visualizations](../../getting-started/visualizations.md) and [Queries](../../getting-started/queries.md).

- **Dune Patrons** including the crypto communities, protocols, and companies who, with the help of Dune Wizards, leverage Dune's powers to solve problems and share insights within their organizations.
