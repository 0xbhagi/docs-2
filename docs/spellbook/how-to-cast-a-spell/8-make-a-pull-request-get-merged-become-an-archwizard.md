With all this out of the way, it’s time to submit a PR to the official Spellbook!

To do that, make sure you Commit your local changes to your Spellbook GitHub fork.

Then, head over to your fork on Github, find the “Contribute” dropdown towards the top of the page, open that and smash the “Open pull request button.”

Give your PR an appropriate message, then wait for the comments to roll in!

None of us are perfect, so pretty much all of us get comments from the Team for things we need to fix or improve with our Spells before they’ll approve the pull request.

Once you’ve addressed all the comments, your Spell will be approved and you’ll be one of the select few Dune Archwizards! 🧙
