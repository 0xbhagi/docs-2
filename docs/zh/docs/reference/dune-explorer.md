Here's a quick overview of the Dune Explorer!

We'll quickly review the different ways you can search for Dashboards, Queries, and Wizards to find inspiration... and forkable Queries to help you get to making ðŸ’« faster.

When you head to [dune.com](https://dune.com), you'll land on the Dashboards section of the Dune Explorer.

You'll also see tabs at the top for Queries, Wizards, and Teams.

## Dashboards

![dune explorer home](images/dune-explorer-home.png)

By default, [Dashboard Explorer](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) shows Dashboards that have been Trending (getting a lot of stars) in the last 4 hours.

Looking to the right sidebar, we can sort this list by:

1. **Favorites** - Dashboards that have gotten the most stars in the last 1/7/30 days as well as all time.
2. **Trending** - Dashboards that have been getting more attention in the last 1/4/24 hours.
3. **New** - Dashboards sorted by publish time.

And we can filter this list by:

1. Using the "Search for dashboards" text field to find dashboards by keyword.
2. Click on one of the "Popular dashboard tags" to see dashboards with that tag.
