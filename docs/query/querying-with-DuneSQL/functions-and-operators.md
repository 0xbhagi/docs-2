This chapter describes the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by DuneSQL. They allow you to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources.

If you are looking for a specific function or operator, see the full alphabetical list or the full list by topic. Using SHOW FUNCTIONS returns a list of all available functions, including custom functions, with all supported arguments and a short description.

Also see the SQL data types and the SQL statement and syntax reference.
