!!!note 
    This section has to be maintained by us since we are implementing our own functions and operators and changing existing ones. 


This chapter describes the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by Trino. They allow you to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources.

If you are looking for a specific function or operator, see the full alphabetical list or the full list by topic. Using ``SHOW FUNCTIONS`` returns a list of all available functions, including custom functions, with all supported arguments and a short description.
