!!!note
    Not quite sure what I am going to do with this whole section as we are mostly using very basic Select statements.
    I think I can summarize this whole section on just one page. 

This chapter describes the SQL syntax used in Trino.

A reference to the supported SQL data types is available.

Trino also provides numerous SQL functions and operators.
