title: Old Query Engines
description: This Page describes the old query engines that will soon be depreceated. SparkSQL and PostgresSQL will be replaced by DuneSQL.   
---

## Overview

Dune currently supports three different query engines:  

- DuneSQL  
- SparkSQL  
- PostgreSQL  

The SparkSQL and PostgreSQL query engines are being deprecated and will be replaced by DuneSQL.

## Sunsetting Schedule

The following table shows the schedule for the sunsetting of the old query engines.

| Date       | 11/4/2023      | 15/05/2023              | 05/06/2023     | 01/07/2023          |
| -----------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| SparkSQL   | Fair Warning   | Drop from data explorer | Edits disabled | Stop ingesting data |
| PostgreSQL | Fair Warning   | Drop from data explorer | Edits disabled | Stop ingesting data |



## SparkSQL

SparkSQL is a query engine that is based on Apache Spark.  
This Query engine already runs on our V2 database, so the data you can query is the same as with DuneSQL.  
Unfortunately SparkSQL is not a good fit for our use case and therefore we are deprecating it.

SparkSQL is still in production and will be supported until **01/07/2023**. After that date, SparkSQL will be removed from production and all queries will be migrated to DuneSQL.

You can read more about SparkSQL in the [SparkSQL documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref.html).

## PostgreSQL

Our PostgresSQL database and query engine are the oldest parts of Dune Analytics. PostgresSQL does not scale well and therefore we are deprecating it.  
Postgres is an entirely different database than our V2 database and therefore the data you can query is different.  

PostgresSQL is still in production and will be supported until **01/07/2023**. After that date, PostgresSQL will be removed from production and all queries will be migrated to DuneSQL.

You can read more about PostgreSQL in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

## Migrating Queries

To migrate your queries from SparkSQL or PostgreSQL to DuneSQL, you can use the [DuneSQL migration tool](https://dune.com/migrate). This tool will automatically convert your queries to DuneSQL. The Tool is based on GPT4 and still under active development, we will share updates as we make progress. 

### Migrating from SparkSQL

Migrating queries from SparkSQL to DuneSQL is somewhat easy. The two query engines query the same data and therefore the queries are very similar.

### Migrating from PostgreSQL

Migrating queries from PostgreSQL to DuneSQL is a bit more difficult. The two query engines query different data and therefore the queries are very different. Additionally, the query engines are made for use cases.
