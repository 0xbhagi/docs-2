## Queries are the heart of Dune's magic ðŸ’–

 Queries the primary building blocks Wizards use to pull blockchain data from Dune's database, transform it into something interesting with SQL functions, then and either make visualizations and dashboards to share using [dune.com](https://dune.com) or just about anything imaginable via the [Dune AP../api/index.md.md).

 Through the âœ¨ of Dune, Queries let Wizards answer any question!

To create a new Query on [dune.com](https://dune.com), simply click `New Query` in the top right corner:

This will take you to the Query Editor where you can build Dune Queries. The Query Editor is made up of three parts:

- The [**Data Explorer**](../app/queries/data-explorer.md) on the left
- The [**Query Window**](../app/queries/query-window.md) on the right
- The [**Query Results**](../app/queries/query-results.md) at the bottom

You can change the size of each of part by dragging the corresponding Dune logo around:
