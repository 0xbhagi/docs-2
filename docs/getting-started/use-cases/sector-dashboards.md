title: Sector Dashboards
---

**Sector Dashboards allow you to get an overview of an entire sector of the crypto economy and analyze what's happening in real time.**

Let's explore this with some examples:

## [Dex Metrics](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics) by [@hagaetc](https://dune.com/hagaetc)

This Dashboard allows you to view data and learn about the entire Decentralized Exchange sector at a glance.

Here you can see metrics like Dex Volume, Market Share, and Total Volume across all exchanges, along with many more stats.

Together they make it easy to compare the performance of different DEXes against each other and evaluate the performance of the entire sector.

All of these stats and charts update in real time and are maintained by the community; if a new DEX wants to be added to this Dashboard, all they have to do is submit their code to our public GitHub. More on this in [Spells](../../reference/tables/spells/index.md).

## [Indices](https://dune.com/0xBoxer/indices-products) by [@0xBoxer](https://dune.com/0xBoxer)

Another interesting sector-based Dune Dashboard covers Indices.

Here again, you can evaluate the entire state of a sector in one glance to compare different products and projects with ease.

## [Lending](https://dune.com/drethereum/Lending-Analysis) by [@drethereum](https://dune.com/drethereum)

The same applies for lending protocols, you can easily check the state of lending as a sector and compare protocol performance.
