The Query Results section is where you can see the data your Query returns after you run it.

To get the results of your Query the first time, smash that <span class="fk-btn-1">Run</span> button in the orange box below the Query Window:

![first time run query example](images/first-time-run-query-example.png)

After a short time, your Query Results will appear ðŸª„ as a table:

![query results example](images/query-results.png)


!!! warning
    Queries run on the database you've currently selected in the Data Explorer dropdown. EG if you run a Query that uses Dune V1 Ethereum data, it will fail to run if you select another V1 Blockchain dataset or Dune V2:
    
    ![query failed when switching data sets](images/query-failed-switching-datasets.gif)

Above your Results table you'll find:
  
  1. The "Query Results" tab; if you make more Visualizations they'll appear as tabs next to this one.
  2. The <span class="fk-btn-2">New Visualization</span> button which lets you make [Visualizations](../visualizations) out of your Query data.
  3. "Last run" and "Last run took" times so you can know how fresh your Results data is as well as a reference point for how long it might take you to Run again (could be more or less time depending on how you've modified your Query).
  4. The <span class="fk-btn-1">Run</span> button (to re-run your Query as you change it or to).

### Saving Your Query

After running your Query at least once, you'll see the <span class="fk-btn-1">Save</span> button appear above the Query Window:

![a wild save button appears](images/a-wild-save-button-appears.png)

Click it to see a pop up that asks you to give your Query a name, with the option to make this Query private (*~if~* you're a [Dune Premium](../../reference/pricing.md) user):

![first time saving query example](images/first-time-saving-query-popup.png)

After your first Save, above the Query Window you'll find:

1. The <span class="fk-btn-3">Star</span> button which will let you see how many stars your Query has, and star it yourself.
2. The <span class="fk-btn-3">Embed</span> button for you and others to embed this Query on other web pages.
3. The <span class="fk-btn-3">Fork</span> button for you and others to create a copy of this Query to modify to your hearts content ðŸ’– 

![star embed and fork buttons](images/star-embed-fork-buttons.png)

Anytime you make further changes the <span class="fk-btn-1">Run</span> button will become a <span class="fk-btn-1">Save and run</span> button:

![save and run button](images/save-and-run-button.png)

This does what you might expect (saves your changes and re-runs your Query).

### Re-Running Your Query

When you re-run your Query, your Results table will be blank until the new data is ready and loaded:

![table results clear while running](images/table-clear-while-running.png)

The <span class="fk-btn-1">Run</span> button will change to show:

1. How long your Query has been running
2. A <span class="fk-btn-3">Cancel</span> button (in case you're tired of waiting!)

### Formatting Results Tables

You can change the formatting and appearance of your Query Results tables with the options below the table.

What do we have here? ðŸ‘€

1. The <span class="fk-btn-3">Add to dashboard</span> button which won't work until you've [saved your Query](#saving-your-query). Learn more about [making Dashboards here](../dashboards.md).
2. A field to change your table's Title.
3. Settings for each of your columns.

Column settings are pretty straightforward:

- Title let's you change the column's title
- Align lets you change the column data's text alignment
- Format lets you change how numbers are formatted, more on that just below ðŸ‘‡.
- Hide column removes the column from your table's display
- Colored positive values makes your column's positive values <span style="color: var(--success-green);">green</span>.
- Colored negative values makes your column's negative values <span style="color: var(--danger-red);">red</span>.

Column number formatting follow this logic:

| Value        | Number format | Output          | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 1256784.3745 | 0\[.]0a     | 1.2m            | <p>Displays the value in an abbreviated format.</p><p>Will display decimals of the abbreviated number according to count of zeroes after the dot.</p> |
| 1256784.3745 | $0\[.]0a    | $1.2m           | Adheres to the same methods as before, but adds a $ prefix.                                                                                           |

### Visualizations

To make Visualizations out of your Query Results, start by, you guessed it, smashing that <span class="fk-btn-2">New Visualization</span> button (a normal click will also work if you really prefer).
