### Why learn to use Dune?

get hired, don't deal with raw data, learn from hundreds of other analysts, don't build an infra pipeline

- call out key use cases here, aligned with product marketing materials
- mention if they want API then go to API quickstart instead
- call out what values/time Dune is saving for you quickly

### Analyze Web3 Data: DEX Volumes

In this short guide, we'll walk you through how to get the weekly USD volume traded by DEXs in the last six months on Ethereum. You'll learn how to write a basic SQL query and create a visualization in Dune. 

Click through the interactive walkthrough below to understand how to leverage the `dex.trades` table for this basic analysis.

Once we have this query, you can leverage it in future queries by tracking the query id (see the URL).

Now, `dex.trades` is a spellbook table, meaning that it's an abstracted table that's been put together by hundreds of star analysts in the community, supported by the Dune team. You can find spellbook table columns [defined here](https://spellbook-docs.dune.com/#!/model/model.spellbook.dex_trades). The lower level tables you'll often work with are `raw` and `decoded` tables. You'll find out how to work with these in the guides mentioned in the [advanced section](five_minutes.md).
