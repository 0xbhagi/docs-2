### Analyze Web3 Data In Three Easy Steps

In this short guide, we'll walk you through how to get the weekly USD volume traded by DEXs in the last six months on Ethereum. You'll learn how to write a basic SQL query and create a visualization in Dune. 

- show off dex.trades with table preview and search, mention these have been put together by hundreds of star analysts in the community, supported by the Dune team.

- do a basic aggregation of 7 days and order by

- create visualization with line chart and stacked bar chart, show off formatting

- mention what the other table types are that are abstracted away but still accessible if you would like (show off all the tables in spellbook doc screenshot)

- must be some way of showing off query-a-query?
- show off labels in some way in the future?

A fundamental understanding of SQL is needed to be able to successfully query for data on Dune.

[SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) is widely used in the Software Development industry and you can find a lot of non-Dune specific documentation about it. This often times helps with answering Query related questions since most answers can easily be found in the internet.
